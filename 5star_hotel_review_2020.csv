Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Great hotel great location,My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and gave it a top rating because for the money I think it is a great hotel. We were toying with paying substantially more to stay at the Marina Bay Sands but glad we picked this instead. The rooms are a good size and quiet which was important for us and the location was just off Orchard road with a short walk to the MRT station. The taxi ride from the airport was 30 minutes and I downloaded the GRAB app so the cost was only $20. We didnâ€™t end up using the pool or gym but both looked good for a city centre hotel.,Jan-20,Travelled as a couple,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Apr-20,3,Staycation during Covid-19,"We booked a one night stay at this hotel to chill out and shop along Orchard Road on a weekday which we seldom have the chance to do during normal days. The S$198 price tag comes with breakfast for 2 at the highly acclaimed Carousel Cafe and also free access to the Premier Lounge so we thought it was quite a good deal. The location was great especially after a long day of shopping and dinner. We didnâ€™t use the pool as it was small and boring. The premier lounge was a disappointment as there were only machine coffee, teabags, machine soft drinks, peanuts/potato chips and some biscuits. No finger food, alcohol or can drinks that you can bring back to your room. The room was small but ok, the aircon has a damp smell but we bear with it. Carousel is grossly over-rated, as the breakfast spread wasnâ€™t impressive. All-in I think we got our S$198 worth of hotel stay in Singapore, nothing more and nothing less.â€¦",Mar-20,Travelled as a couple,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,What a let Down!,"This is not the first time my husband and I chose The Royal Plaza. We came back to it because of the pleasant memories we had in the past. However, our recent stay was disappointing. When we checked in, we were told in a stern tone by the check-in staff that we had not paid so they took a fairly large amount from our credit card. When we insisted that we had paid through our agent, we were told that the hotel is unaware of this. Later, we went back to sort this out and another staff asked to photocopy our itinerary and said that they will try to sort it out. All this with not even a friendly tone or reassuring smile. We then emailed our agent who swiftly sorted everything out for us and informed us via email. Unfortunately, the hotel did not even assure us of this.   Each day when we went for breakfast, we felt like interlopers as they took down our room number to double check whether we were entitled for breakfast. All staff had a glum expression except for this warm and lovely female staff, Kasturi at the Premium lounge. She served with gusto and really made us feel welcome.  We are checking into the hotel again on our way home from another holiday. You may ask why we are returning to the Royal Plaza? The location is fabulous and for the obvious reason that we pre-booked everything a few months back so it's a case of 'ignorance is bliss'.  We hope to feel more welcome on our return in a few days' time or we will definitely re-consider not staying at this once endearing hotel.â€¦",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,What the Duck Staycation!!!,Value for money deal not to be missed by Singaporeans who want to get away amidst COVID-19. They take care of you and ensure social responsibility is looked into with temperature screening and contact tracing.,Feb-20,,

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,4,Good clean hotel conveniently located near to shopping district,Pleasant Hotel with comfortable beds and friendly staff but a little lacking in character or atmosphere. Ok for an overnight stay but would personally prefer somewhere that you can relax in with a little more going on than the uninspiring but efficient public areas,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,Dissatisfy,Dissatisfied  This time it was surprisingly dissatisfied.no action was taken regarding an unnecessary situation at the breakfast buffet even after we complained.we have been staying der fr 9 years and we were expecting more then wt they provided this time .,Jan-20,,

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Nov-20,3,Very average !,"I am posting the review again as in my fury posted with a new profile and not my existing one ðŸ˜‚  Yes, they goofed up big time with my food on my first day of stay at home quarantine , did not serve me dinner till 10 pm instead of 6 to 7 pm and delayed my grab food delivery by 30 mins rendering it tasteless and cold   That was very disappointing but on the balance once I have calmed down the  rest :  rooms are ok , view is sad, staff at check in very courteous and quality of in room amnesties above average , sometimes the standard meals pretty good so on the balance they are average and not as bad as I initially blurred out   Makes you realise services are very perceptive and how you handle moments of truth frames the users experience and rating of you..Wonâ€™t be paying my ownâ€¦",Nov-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Thank you!,"The rooms were spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable! My family had a wonderful staycation with Royal Plaza on Scotts ! Thank you for your warm hospitality and service! We look forward to come.back once again! ðŸ˜„",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,4,Holiday,"Bath tub should be equipped w mobile/detachable shower head for the ease of showering young kid, which I specifically asked for during booking via email but was told none of premier room has it upon check in. Hence a bit of disappointment.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Fantastic stay!,Fantastic stay with a superb breakfast! The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the shopping area in Orchard Road. The dining experience for breakfast and dinner exceeded our expectations and we will return for another stay.,Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Great property  at a prime location,The property is beautifully built and is at a prime location. Less than 3 km from Little India. There are shopping places nearby the hotel as well. Amenities are very nice. Comfortable family stay. The hotel wifi ws also nice.,Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,Very good,"Recommended hotels, best price performance, location near top notch mall, have a personal bus stop station, near MRT station, near movie theaters, my experience, I can check in start from 9am without additional  payment what a surprise...",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Sep-20,3,Validity of vouchers,"Good things first: I love this place! This hotel has a great reputation, nice food (Carousel you're great!), and convenient location. Personally, I've not stayed here before but I've visited the Carousel buffet a couple of times, and it never fails to impress me.  Now unfortunately the bad: I've had some vouchers that I have been intending to redeem, but unfortunately due to covid, I was unable to visit the hotel. As the vouchers were expiring in November, I wrote to roomres for help in extending the validity during July 2020, hoping that the hotel will understand my concerns.  The roomres team requested for a photo of my vouchers so that they can ask their management for approval, which I gladly obliged, thinking all was good, as they said that they understood my concerns.  Inâ€¦",Sep-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,1,"Queue-cation, not staycation","I booked 3 rooms for a family staycation. Unfortunately much of my stay was spent in crowded queues - queue for check in, queue for breakfast.   Safe- distancing was not observed and I truly felt concerned and guilty for exposing my family to increased health risk by booking this stay at Royal Plaza at Scotts.  Management could have planned in advance to increase front office capacity and allocated additional breakfast venues - given the high bookings they have received during the March holidays and in view of government social distancing measures.  I ended up foregoing the inclusive breakfast and checked out early at 10am - for the sake of my familyâ€™s health.... and pushed financial considerations aside  Poor crowd control and planning - not what we need to help us fight theâ€¦",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,Good pick for a 3 day stay in Singapore,"We wanted a good quality hotel located near the MRT and were pleased with our stay here. You can get the MRT from Changi to Orchard which is 200m from the hotel, or the 36 bus which drops off just around the corner, maybe 400m or a metered taxi which at 8pm cost us $s40 and the GRAB car back at 8pm cost $s22. Download the GRAB app before you go (just like UBER). Make sure you get a tourist travel card from the MRT ticket office as this is very cheap to use for your stay and the MRT and buses are very efficient. The staff were excellent, our room on the 3rd floor was comfortable, just a couple of comments - common to most hotels there is no drawer space so you live out of a suitcase. The listing sold a 'free mini bar' which is in fact just water - that needs to be changed. Theâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Excellent Hotel,"From the moment we were greeted at the door until the doorman hailed our departing taxi the service, staff, facilities, breakfast buffet were superb.  The room was large, bathroom included a bath, the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in, the pool was clean and towels were provided, staff very friendly, polite and always happy to help.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Nov-20,1,Terrible Despicable Horrible ! Royal ****,"I checked in for my Quarantine SHM stay , the first day never got food for dinner   Delivery time of 7.30 nothing came by 9 pm , ordered on grab food , they lost my food or the staff ate it..Ha ha   The modest royal hotel in KL where I did my quarantine in KL is 10x better then this bunch of idiots   Just as I was typing my original meal arrived no sign of my grab delivery yet",Nov-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,3,Okay-ish hotel with good staff,"Royal Plaza on Scotts is surely not a 5 star hotel, the pool is really *small* and rooms are just standard size. Check-in process is efficient even though there is big weekend crowd. Likewise, another long queue for breakfast over weekend, but the staff managed this crowd well.  For those with young children and especially thinking of staycation - the swimming pool size would be big disappointment. Also, there are NO KIDS CHANNELS on TV and NO other amenities like Children play-rooms etc.  Few other letdowns are the not-so-clean bedsheets, much-hyped 'free mini bar' that comes with 2 bottles of water and 2 small cups of juice, gym with half of the equipment under maintenance. The room given to us doesn't have any view, but the hotel is in city center - so can't complain much. â€¦",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,4,Good experience,Location was excellent. Staff was helpful and services were very good. Room service was quick unlike most hotels. Room was clean and comfortable and the only place i know who provides a free mini bar.,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,4,Great for staycation,"Good location, spacious room. Comfortable bed, nothing much to complain about the room.  Could improve on crowd control, the queue for the breakfast buffet and check out was really long. May want to consider express checkout service for local guests.",Mar-20,,

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,great,ultra clean room with plenty of space and brand spanking new.  The restaurant looked very busy all the time and seems to be having high awards. staff efficient and location great.  recommended for couples and singles.,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,3,Not a kid friendly hotel.,"No kids channel on tv and problem with AC, hot water and wifi..  other than that, location is great! At the heart of Orchard road. Booked  a suite n wishEd it was slightly more bigger.  Hotel staffs are friendly and smiley.",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,4,Great Stay,"Excellent stay at the hotel. Will always look forward to return. Another thing great about this hotel was, it has a halal restaurant called Carousel, which is perfect! Good location, near the exciting malls and great to just walk around Orchard.",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Perfect venue for staycation,"Location is amazing, as itâ€™s located at prime Orchard road. Room is newly renovated and spacious, and the bed was divine! Breakfast at carousel was a treat and service staff was friendly and  approachable. Definitely will stay here again!",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,3,ok and average,Nothing fancy nor memorable. More can be improved especially the suite rooms and premiere lounge. Good thing is the check-in and check-out as the front office staff were friendly and efficient. Location is the main draw to this hotel.,Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Wonderful experience,I am happy to have chosen this hotel for a staycation. Check-in and check-out was a breeze one. Breakfast buffer - wide variety.  Nothing else that i could ask for more.  I will come back for sâ€™more staycations in this hotel.,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,3,Need more improvement,"I booked a suite for my husband's birthday, check in is just as ordinary. The room is big, clean and pleasant.  The breakfast at Carousel is average, did not meet expectation. Overall experience this time round is average.",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,4,3 days business trip,Welcoming and staff at the top like usual. Confort and cleanless of the room. Very convenient location with all facilities in the area. Breackfast is the best I know. If something to improve: Taxi waiting at rush hours....,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,Business trip in Singapore,Rooms okay. Facilities for working can be improved. Lobby very noisy. Breakfast is good. I did not try room service nor restaurant for lunch or dinner. Good location and very handy for shopping and moving with public transport,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,4,Awesome staycay,"Stayed during the what the duck promo. Was upgraded to premiere room for free. Also had access to the premiere lounge. Great room with good pillows and air con.   Breakfast wise, was ok if there was enough service staff to fill up the food trays timely.   I love how warm the reception staff were.",Mar-20,,

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,NYE Carousel Buffet,"Excellent !  Went as a family of 4 (including 2 teenage girls) for their New Years Eve buffet. Had emailed before we arrived in Singapore and initially had to be put on the wait list, but the staff managed to secure us a table the day before NYE. From the minute we walked in the staff and the experience was great. Loads of lovely food of every continent / culture. Highly recommended !",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,Best location!,Excellent and Friendly staff members. Location is superb and central to many big malls. Getting groceries is conveniently next door at Isetan. Duty Free Mall is at the same building and convenient to get gifts.,Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,4,Excellent hotel,"Except property, great location, on Orchard, yet just off it! The rooms are very comfortable and very spacious!! The service is absolutely top class and it is no wonder that the property has won so many independent property awards. Good value for money and very courteous staff. Thank you",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Love it,Our overall experience was good. Hotel room was nice n the staff was friendly as well. Only housekeeping was a bit slow. And our portable wifi was not in a good condition (the battery needs to be charged all the time). Other than that all was good.,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,Great location but didnâ€™t feel very welcomed,"We stayed recently with our kids. Arrived at the hotel with our reservation in hand and hotel didnâ€™t have record of it. They managed to find a room and the reservation in the back end but were not apologetic despite having booked months in advance - not the kind of service expected when paying over $300 a night.   Room was fine, great aircon and location is excellent for orchard rd. Itâ€™s a clean, average hotel but stayed in other properties in Singapore where staff are a lot more welcoming and service much better.  Mention must be given to the doorman who was the only friendly staff member we spoke with.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,A fantastic stay. Thank You,"We had a club room on the 15th floor and our door was right opposite the doors to the club lounge! Hotel service was excellent, breakfast was excellent (but a little too predictable!) and the club lounge was a great place to just sit, and think, and plan the next day of activities. We will be back again. Thanks again for a great stay.",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,4,Great location & price,"We had a nice stay here over Xmas and the kids enjoyed the pool,  with easy access to all transport links and shops. Visit the Newton open food court which is only a short walkway. Metro is also very close as are the main shops.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,3,Great location but fail to impress,"Booked the hotel for a staycation and this is the first time in all my years of staycation that I am so disappointed.  Quote from website ""At Royal Plaza on Scotts, we make every effort to make your hotel stay in Singapore and dining experience memorable"".... Indeed memorable and its not good kind...  Firstly location of hotel is great, upon checking into our room we are quite happy with the amenities and that it is a smoke free hotel.   We visited the Premium Lounge on 15th floor and sad to say that it is far from premium experience. As compared to another hotel in Chinatown, their club lounge has better service, and light refreshment that makes the stay more comfortable.   We also visited its pool... the journey to the pool seems like a walk into time machine and you feel likeâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,May-20,4,early christmas,"The location is close to ion orchard and other shopping centers. because i want to enjoy the christmas atmosphere in singapore, the location of this hotel is the best i think. not too expensive, clean hotel, friendly service, but when I stayed the hotel was quite crowded.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Perfect for staycation,Stayed 2 nights for the local resident promotion. Rooms are reasonably big and location is very good. Very near to Far East Plaza and Shaw Centre. Breakfast buffet has very good spread and the lounge on 15th floor is well-maintained. Nice pineapple cookies. There is also a 24h gym that is very useful for fitness buffs. Please continue to have promotions for locals. Thank you,Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,2,Bad Experience,"Good things about this hotel: 1. Location 2. Friendly staff 3. Pocket wifi (no need to buy local simcard)  Bad things: 1. Very ordinary breakfast. No changes in menu during my stays. Food taste so-so (only like Singapore soup) 2. Ask the staff to change bed sheet, but she didn't understand. So your staff didn't change the sheet. 3. Experienced annoying sounds at night and dawn.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","Stayed here at the start of the Coronavirus situation and every time we entered the hotel they took our temperatures, a proactive approach which was very good. Our room was spacious, the bed really comfortable, breakfast selection really good and tasty. Every member of staff was excellent, smiling and they could not do enough for us. There is a small iPhone sized box in each room that you set, then carry in your pocket which gives free internet access in Singapore wherever you travel. Reception staff set this up for me and I was good to go. Location is great, only a minute to the MRT and Orchard Rd with its plethora of shops and restaurants. Oh and we used the pool on 5th floor, quite enclosed but comfy sun beds and free coffee machine by it.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,2,Bed-type did not meet expectation as stated in the check-in voucher,The bed-type of 2 single beds (instead of a queen bed) was in fact not available nor registered in the hotel system although it was booked with this specific request online. I think Trip.com and the hotel should have communicated clearly with no ambiguity and inconsistent information in online booking system,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Great place to stay,"Great value for money in the middle of Singapore. Warm welcome, excellent food and great service. We have been here for many many times and always enjoy to come back. Especially due to corona virus situation we felt very safe and well informed. Every place equipped with hand sanitizers.",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,4,"Our second stay - great hotel, excellent location.","Love this hotel.  Location is great being close to ION shopping centre and MRT, along with other shopping centres within walking distance.  Rooms tidy and clean and staff always helpful.  We ate at Carousel Restaurant for New Years Eve dinner - it was excellent.  Top quality seafood and other dishes, service was great and definitely value for money.  Surprising how quiet the rooms were this time. Beds very comfortable.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Easy Singapore Stopover,A nice hotel with helpful staff. The bed was very comfortable. Awesome shower. Very convenient location. Lots of shops nearby. Only issue was our children's room was several rooms down the corridor and we would have preferred it closer.,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Excellent,"the lobby itself already caught my eye. its beautiful. the hotel is strategically located near orchard mrt station, and its near to ION mall. the room is clean, spacious, bed is extremely comfy. i had a perfect stay",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,1,Heartless in a time of need,I was due to visit Singapore on the way to a medical conference overseas. The conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus and as a medical professional i have been asked to stay in Australia to assist with the current situation. Also the government has directed for the 1st time in history 'Do Not Travel' -despite this this hotel would not allow me to reschedule to the new conference date in September. Instead they took my money and said there was no reason I could still not come. All of my other bookings I have had to cancel for this trip and 2 others planned have allowed free cancellation or at least a free rebook. Not this hotel,Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,3,Singapore stay - Premium room- Not so good,We stayed at the premium room for 5 nights. The first 2 nights were staying on the 11th floor. Check-in was quick. Disappointed with the room due to loud noise and smoke fume from next door room (smoke came in through the connecting door) despite of non-smoking floor. The next day we moved and were located to more quieter room.  We had access to the Royal Club Lounge on the 15th floor for some refreshments and snacks which was great. Room was quite large with basic amenities provided and staff were helpful. Location is near Orchard Road with ION and Isetan are a few steps away.,Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,5,Great Stay!,We had a great stay at Royal Plaza. Location was great. Staff were friendly. Room was very clean. Breakfast was very good but too bad the dinner is fully booked and we couldnt experience dinner at Carousel.,Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,4,Staycation with Young children,"Perfect location and nearby eateries and shopping mall. Staff are polite and friendly. Starbucks are just outside the main lobby which is great for coffee lover. However, it would be more ideal if there is a children pool or playground.",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Exceptional service,"What makes Royal Plaza stand out is the exceptional service rendered by all staff. Every department exudes a positive energy towards pleasing their guests and this makes all the difference. In addition the hotel is very conveniently located on Orchard Road, making conveyance very easy. The newly refurbished room was spacious and clean. I stayed in room 825, which met my expectations. Royal Plaza will continue to be my choice of preference when in Singapore.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Apr-20,5,ideal location. friendly staff,"ideal location very near subway station orchard. club room good with the gentlemen in the club lounge very friendly and accomodating. staff on reception exceptional, going beyond to contact the airline regarding lost kindle. food in restaurant plantiful and varied if very busy.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Mar-20,2,Poor crowd control,"We booked two rooms and were extremely alarmed to arrive at the hotel and be faced with such a crowd at a time where social distancing is highly recommend. Even in house guests were not able to dine at the in house buffet restaurant due to an excessively generous promotion for all patrons. We ended up cancelling the stay since the in house restaurant, gym, pool are all unavailable.   We are impressed by the front desk teamâ€™s patience in the face of such a crowd. I believe the reservations and marketing team failed to limit the rooms for their promotion and were instead chasing numbers.   Sadly this has brought down the brand image of an otherwise reputable hotel along Orchard road.",Mar-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,My must go to hotel when in Singapore!,"Be it for leisure or for work, I can't stray away from RP on Scotts! Location, service, room quality and comfort have always been consistently maintained.   Ability to stow our bags during the need for early checkouts w late flights have always been accomodating to different type of travelers.   Halal buffet breakfast and dinners make it easy for Muslim travelers to have meals with the hotel be it at their restaurants or as room service orders.   It is pricey considering all of the factors, but worth every penny :)",Nov-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,4,Stayed two nights...wished we'd planned for more,"We stayed at this property for two nights before our Asian cruise to get over our long flight and to experience Singapore. Super glad we did and wished we had planned for more days. A great hotel. Super friendly and helpful staff. Our luggage did not arrive with us on our flight (missed the connecting flight). The concierge staff were very proactive and helpful in following up with the delivery company for us. Very spacious, quiet room and wonderful buffet breakfast.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,3,Not For Tourists!,Don't be fooled by the stunning entrance - the room although spacious and spotlessly clean lacked facilities.  There was only hanging space for clothes and no drawer space so we basically lived out of our suitcase.  Minimal tea and coffee in the room but only Coffeemate so had to go out and buy milk for tea.   There was no Tourist information available for places to go and we had to ask for a map.  The only Bar was a very small area on the 1st floor open from 6pm till 10pm so nowhere to sit and relax. I had asked on booking for a room on a low floor as I do not care for Lifts and preferred to use the stairs.  On arrival I was taken through the kitchens to a back staircase to get to the 4th floor!  I did find a better route by myself but having asked the question about stairsâ€¦,Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Nov-20,5,Beautifully managed lovely hotel in the city,"Lovely property managed very well, teally great staff and beautifully furnished comfy rooms woth a great Mini bar service. Awsome restaraunt and breakfast, one should never miss whilst in Singapore. Since its close to Orchard road and Far east plaza, even shopping from here is not a problem. For sure a 5 star ++ property in my book. Well done team from door to Gm makes you feel at home and welcome.",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,Will Come Back Again,"The room rate was really attractive with free upgrade to Premier Room . There is light snack (eg. nuts, biscuits and chips) in the Premier Lounge all day long. and guest could select from a range of hot and cold beverages. However, unlike the Premier Lounges in other hotels, this one does not serve evening cocktail. Overall, its a great staycation where service staff is friendly and location is fantastic.",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jun-20,2,Not up to the standards of other 4 or 5 Star Hotels in Singapore,"Our stay at the Royal Plaza on Scotts was in February 2020. The first impression of the Hotel was good. Very good in fact. But the first evening, when we visited the Hotel's ""Premier Lounge"" we were really dissapointed. The Lounge was completely empty, and for a reason! There were only coffee and tea and some cookies and nuts. That's all! If you wanted anything to eat or drink, you had to buy it from the menu. Having paid a higher rate to get a larger room, have breaksfast included AND the access to the Hotel's Lounge, we really feel that this service was not up to the standards of any 4 or 5 Star Hotels in Singapore (or any other country). Breakfast buffet was served in the Restaurant at the lobby. It was good but repetitive - everyday the selection of plates was the same - andâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Feb-20,5,Always at the Top Notch,"Location friendly, clean rooms and hotel corridors, breakfast variety that changes everyday in some section (not all but some), fast elevators, high speed wifi, and the best thing is that they provide portable wifi with good connection.   A little hassle to connect I need to ask assistance from the front desk though because you need to download an app.   Despite of all the goodness about the hotel and the comfortable stay, it lost its hositality touch from the staff. Me and my family barely got any greetings from them.",Jan-20,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,2,Not as good as before,"I used to stay at this hotel quite often. One of the reasons was that there were several choices of free drinks provided in the roomâ€™s fridge (soft drinks, juices, and even Bir Bintang). I noticed that the owner of this hotel has changed, because some of the services that were previously provided are now reduced or even no longer provided, such as the free drinks, now only provided 2 small cups of juice; and 2 bottles of water on the first day, instead of 4 bottles on other days. When I arrived at the hotel and it was already 4 p.m., the room was not ready until 5 p.m., while the check in time should be at 2. The amenities were also lacking.

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Jan-20,5,Royal Plaza on Scotts Road - December 2019 stay,"An excellent stay at a venue we consider our home from home in Singapore. We were very well received and shown to our room despite arriving very early in the morning (rooms are usually only available after 2 pm on day of arrival). Staff were polite and helpful. Rooms well appointed. Breakfast selection on the premium floors is limited, so we opted to have breakfast in the main dining hall on the ground floor. Because of the festive season the hotel was at capacity which created some congestion in the dining area. Food choice was excellent. Food quality was excellent. We will recommend Royal Plaza on Scotts Road without doubt to any traveller. We will also like to be kept informed of any special deals (including flights if possible).",Dec-19,,
Royal Plaza on Scotts,Aug-20,3,Expect the equivalent of a US Sheraton with a lot of people and it will be fine,"I wasn't crazy about this place. It reminds me of the Sheratons in the US, which is okay but it's not a five start hotel by US standards. First, they were late for house cleaning one day and didn't come until 3 p.m. because they were busy. Also, my view was of an apartment building where I saw laundry hanging - I had no privacy so had to keep my curtains closed. They're close to the MRT but it's still 1/3 of a mil to get to the actual entrance to the MRT. And it's super hot there so that's kind of a bigger deal than you might think. If you want to cross the street, it's a big deal - you'll need to go underground and figure out how to get across in the maze. It's okay if you have a lot of time. They did not offer a room service menu. It's easy to hear the doors closing on otherâ€¦",Jan-20,,

Royal Plaza on Scotts,Apr-20,2,Good room but disappointing in every other aspect,"Stayed with a group of friends using the What The Duck promotion. Was pleasantly surprised at how nice the renovated premier rooms are and with a bathtub.   Unfortunately, the good things about this hotel ends here. Room service was terrible. The lady on the phone was extremely rude when I asked for extra towels. She challenged me as to why I needed extra towels and only relented to give me 1 after much back and forth. The â€œpremier loungeâ€ is a complete joke with only some biscuits and juices. The crowd was so big that we had difficulty finding a time to sit. No canapÃ©s, breakfast, alcoholic beverages to speak of. Breakfast was very crowded and we had to wait more than 20 minutes to get in. Spread was highly uninspiring. Gym and pool were also unacceptably small and outdated. â€¦",Mar-20,,

When checking in, the level of accomodation offered was far below what we had expected when making the booking.  Uzair Yaacob (Food and Bev. Operations Manager) noticed my unhappy face while sitting in the bar.  He inquired why, and after hearing our story, insisted on us speaking up and fixing things. Uzairâ€™s attitude towards guests was to keep them happy whilst staying at the Grand Copthorne.  So in the end, we were listened to and amends were made.

One charging plug point  is at the floor skirting level no where near a bed or the writing table . So to make coffee one has to keep the kettle on the carpet.

The room was spacious and very clean, bathroom not so spacious but was equally as clean. Cosy dressing gowns. Very good pool area, gym was small but adequate.

I used the gym almost daily and it wasn't state of the art but it did the job. I did not use the pool but it looked nice with great views. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Best check in experience ever,"Meredith was on check in for our early arrival.  She could not have been more helpful, pleasant and welcoming.  She was able to arrange an early check in and a late check out.  The room was excellent with a lovely view. Our check out proved more problematic and much less accommodating, maybe Meredith can teach her colleagues some tips! Meredith certainly deserves recognition.",Jan-20,,

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Dec-20,3,Not prepared to cope as a SHN facility,Forgot to mention that on my 2nd day  there was a tiny cockroach on dressing table.  I can clearly hear my neighbor room when they turn on the bath tub tap. Aircond is also noisy at certain time of the day.  Otherwise good view from hotel room.,Dec-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Pleasant stay!,"We stayed at the club room for 3 nights and really loved our stay. The benefits were worth paying that little extra. The hotel is pretty central with a lot of restaurants nearby. Since our flight was late in the evening, they were kind enough to provide us with late checkout.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Nov-20,5,Fantastic Service and food!,"Brought my in laws for buffet lunch finally after the Food Capital has resume their opening.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Sep-20,5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,We stayed here last November 2019 with my family and I could say that this is one of our favorite hotels that we ever stayed on. The staff are really friendly and really welcoming. The outside of the hotel is beautiful just as the inside of it. We were really amazed at the interior of the hotel. The room was really nice and comfortable. It was big and we get to have a really great view of our surroundings. The concierge team was really helpful and friendly,Nov-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Great hotel,We stayed in a club superior room which included access to the executive club lounge. Breakfast buffet included which was very good.

Everyone very polite and helpful.,Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Mrs Carol Cowlishaw,"Fabulous hotel located on the Waterfront, with fabulous views of downtown Singapore. The staff were welcoming, efficient and made our stay very special for us, especially Ted (who couldn't do enough for us) and Meredith. The breakfast area was very busy, due to the Chinese New Year, but the tables were cleared quickly, and the robotic omelette maker helped to reduce the queues. It's a great area to have a relaxing drink on Robertson Quay, and is walking distance to Clarke's Quay. Perfect. We would recommend and will definitely stay there again on our next visit.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,4,Very welcoming,Booked a club room for two nights and was impressed by the welcome and he separate front desk facilities on 29 th floor. Breakfast and drinks available on this floor. Very pleasant setting overlooking the rivet. Hotel located beside the  rover with outdoor seating Short stroll to Robertson Quay.

The room is beautiful and very clean. It has a very good view as well. The food is nice. The food quality is very good but not enough chili flavor. All the staff have been very nice and helpful. Thank you for very good stay.,Sep-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Omelette Robot Sabotage!,"My family stayed here for 2 nights to see the city and get over our jet leg before starting on a cruise and I have only positive things to say. The rooms were clean and comfy and the staff helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Pleased to say that the hotel responded very swiftly to a couple of queries I sent via email before our stay too. Very professional.  We were easily able to catch buses / taxis to get to various attractions in the city.  The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. Everything was delicious, there was a good range, and the omelette robot really caught the attention of everyone around (including the chef making omelettes manually who we joked may not have been such a fan...).",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,4,I had a good time,"Stayed there for two nights and three days. Staff was considerate, room was decent and the public bus right outside the hotel provides convenience for those looking to see Singapore's sights. I personally had a good time and recommend it for solo or couple travelers. The room was a bit cramped, though. Despite it clearly set up for two people, there's barely enough breathing room for one.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,4,Excellent Service Delivery,"The ClubRoom option is well worth it.  The only negative is that unruly children of bad parents run around, sticking their fingers in the food and generally spoiling the ambience. A no under 16 years restriction should be made! Otherwise this is a well run hotel and staff are always warm, helpful and friendly.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,5,Best Service!,"We attended a wedding last evening at the level 4 ballroom. I must say that the service is extremely awesome and food was great. We were well attended by Kelvin and Bronn. Both of them consistently take care of our table and despite just both of them serving a few tables, they were fast and efficient. There was never once we need to request for drinks top up. Out of so many weddings i have attended, this is one of the top 3 service we have received and my girlfriends all agreeded on this. Kudos to both of them.  One thing can be improved will be the temperature of the ballroom. Kinda of warm but overall, it is still ok.",Feb-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,5,HOspitality in its best,"A big shout out to the club team steven, nash, ying wei, shirley and jacob for a beautiful room that was given to us. all interaction on each one of them makes us feel at home. We missed to get the name of another gentleman who serves my champagne.Sorry. you are awesome too. The selection of food in the lounge is just nice and we love the view as well. We also want to thank Ted, Meredith, shiho and bruno of guest experience team for a personalized cards and sweet treats. Thank you everyone.Looking forward in our next staycation.",Feb-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,What a great pleasure!,"The hotel is located right on the Singapore river bank in one of its best places. The view is spectacular even from a relatively low floor, but it is recommended to book a club room that comes automatically on one of the upper floors. The biggest perk besides the room itself is the club lounge on the 29th floor with the best views imaginable and with free afternoon tea and snacks, and cocktails in the evenings. Also breakfast on the upper floor makes the day start way better. Wafa, Jacob and the rest of the crew in the lounge are always so attentive! All in all a great experience. And one last thing, next to the hotel a family of otters has established it's territory. A very rare and unique sight to behold! Just please don't feed or interrupt them in anyway.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Fantastic hotel,"Once again another amazing holiday at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront. Huge thanks to Claudia for ensuring we had a smooth check in. Our room had everything we required plus a beautiful river/city view. The staff in the Executive lounge are so kind and helpful especially Ying, Shirley and Bruno. My husband celebrated his birthday when we were there and they surprised him with a card and cake. They also noticed my birthday was just after we departed and I was presented with an early birthday surprise from Ted and Miss Mary who is an absolutely delightful lady. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore. You won't be disappointed.",Dec-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Aug-20,5,Wonderful  service and exception restaurants!,I stayed at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel last year for a short weekend staycation. What's unique about this hotel is simply their service. It was an enjoyable stay as the staff is very accomodating. The hotel breakfast was fantastic too. I miss their local buffets because they serve up really delicious local delights! Don't forget to try out the pastas and grilled meats at Grissini too!,Sep-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,4,Good location,"Although hotel is already old as seen in the kind of phone model in the room and the slightly worn-out color of the bathroom tiles, this hotel is a good choice for people who want comfort and accessibility in Singapore. Location wise, itâ€™s at Roberston Quay where some good restaurants are. Clarke Quay is just 2km away. Merlion is 3km away. For people who love to run, you can easily run from the hotel to Merlion and back with all the pavement and walkway along the river.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,It was perfectly wonderful experience with Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel !!,"Hello, I am irene from South Korea staying in SG. The reason why I booked Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel is just wanted to enjoy Hocance. â€˜Hocanceâ€™ this word is known for meaning of â€˜Hotel + Vacanceâ€™ in Korea.  You know sometimes we want to escape from the general life. Going to the fancy hotel and lying down on the fleecy bed together with TV show and some snacks are kinds of trends in Korea among the young generations to feel something new and enjoyable moments. It was lucky to meet hotelier Mr.Bruno since I was impressed by his kindness. I just booked the cheapest room there. However, My room was upgraded! He even showed and guided me the room condition before I stayed. It was my first time ever! It was also pleased to meet him because he was a Korean guy I metâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,5,Amazing Duty Manager,"This is an overdue review, my brother had recently hosted his wedding at GCW in Jan. We had a party of 5 rooms (excluding wedding room). Duty Manager Mark came to the reception to assist with the check-in, he made everything smooth and pleasant knowing that we are here for wedding.   During the period it was always him helping us with the arrangement. When we needed anything he volunteers to help even though he does not need to.   As the brother of the groom I feel that the wedding was smooth and Mark went above and beyond and is an example to be for everyone working in the hospitality industry. Thank you Mark, my family owes you to that.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Dec-20,1,Pal,"I was staying in room no 2402 & Room provided was full of Cockroaches; have informed hotel staff & next day some spay was made to the room but this did not affect any thing.  I had made another complain for presence of cockroaches so I was provided with a bottle of disinfectant ( HIT) spray. Every day I had to make spray during day & night. I was in the same room inhaling the disinfectant. Pathetic rooms with roaches all around the room.  Food provided was miserable, spicy & not as per request. Have informed many time I do not take sea food but was getting sea food every day.",Nov-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Mar-20,5,Hosted our wedding,"We were very pleased with how our wedding banquet went. From the very first day of meeting up with the hotel manager Serene, the guidance and assurance allowed us to have a fuss free preparation. We are very impressed by the professionalism of the Banquet Manager & other staffs. We have feedbacks from few of our relatives & friends that the food is great and that we made a good choice in the selection of holding our banquet in Grand Copthrone. We really like the holding area outside our ballroom as well. The bridal suite and helper rooms were comfortable and we love the tub. Overall I would like to give a huge thumb up!",Mar-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Mar-20,3,Not so Grand,"The room was comfortable and had everything I needed.  I was disappointed with the service level in the Food Capital restaurant given that the hotel was not hugely busy.  Staff did not smile, were not particularly friendly, took a long time to take my order and the chicken I had was not fully cooked so I could not eat it.  I probably would not stay at this hotel again.",Mar-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Dec-20,2,Review of hotel stay,"Need to keep the room clean, have more tv program & better lighting. Change new mattress, bedsheets & comforter as there is smell & stains. Have new water boiler as there is rust in the water boiler. the room. look too dull cos the lighting is not very bright. The foods was not in good taste cos I'm sure that have guests complained",Nov-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Excellent customer service,"Excellent hotel and good location.  Customer service is exceptional and staff go above and beyond to ensure your stay is both comfortable and enjoyable.   Special thanks to Mary Jeow, Guest Relations Manager and Paul from the Concierge desk for their excellent customer service during our stay.  Highly recommend hotel.",Dec-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Mar-20,5,Lovely stay.,clean and big rooms. Very polite front desk. Everything was good except for the breakfast. Very disappointed with the breakfast menu and display. Came down at around 9 am and food was not top up. Even the hash brown was smashed. Attitude of the chef who made the omelette on that morning was so grumpy i did not enjoy my meal. First time in a luxury hotel with breakfast that was not up to standard.,Mar-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Mar-20,5,Pleasant Experience,"I was with my mum and brother (with his wife and son) on MARCH 7, 2020 for the buffet lunch.  We were served by Madeline (exec sous chef) and her team.  She and her team made our short stay from 12:00 PM - 2:30 PM a very pleasant one.  She introduced us around the selection of food choices with prompt and accurate servings of our order.  We felt a home away from home.  Kudos to Madeline and her team (both kitchen and floor) for keeping up spirits in this challenging period.  Thank you all!",Mar-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Nov-20,4,Orchard Hotel Staycation,Was given Orchard Hotel for staycation instead. Do ensure the cleanliness of the room before assigning to the guests. Found a used very personal item in room beside the bed. The duty manager was also shocked when he saw the items.,Nov-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Sep-20,5,Good to chill along the river @ Alfresco dining,Iâ€™ve seen the alfresco dining at IG and looks interesting to go with my friends. When we arrive about 6PM Mr. Shabarry manager on duty bring me along to river side and introduce what is the best food and drinks option to choose along with my friends also share some history about the river especially the otter. Good timing we saw a family of otters. Have a good conversation and will definitely introduce to my other friends in SG.,Sep-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,New Year in Singapore,We stayed at this hotel for three nights over New Year prior to going on a cruise. We arrived at the hotel early morning following a long flight. Although check in time was not until the afternoon we were quickly allocated a room. The room had a lovely floor to ceiling window overlooking the river across to the marina. On New Years Eve we had a great view of the fireworks. The hotel is located on the river and is in a good location for sight seeing. We had breakfast in the hotel a couple of mornings where there is a good variety of food. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We would certainly stay here again when visiting Singapore.,Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,2,Fourth and last time in this hotel,"Iâ€™m really tired of trying my best to make sure my stay here is as comfortable as can be I have a course Iâ€™m taking in this hotel so I keep coming back to it but this is the last time for sure. My room this was stinking and no matter how much I tried to beg them to fix it, they didnâ€™t do so properly- smell kept coming out of the sewerage of the shower, sink, toilet.  Not an apology. Not a simple gesture to treat me more of a returning loyal customer rather than a nuisance. This morning I got shaken off by a member of the lobby staff named Anil Singh, which is what sealed the decision to never be coming back here. Posh hotel with lots of woo woo but old stuffy stinky rooms and management which seems to not be needing extra clients.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,4,Great affordable staycation,"Have been here for a couple of staycations with my wife. For specific reasons, weâ€™re not able to travel out of SG and were looking for a break and some R&R. This dated but still lovely hotel overlooking the river in Robertson Quay is centrally located for lovely walks, and a stones throw from great bars, restaurants and night festivities. We have opted for Club Rooms, which benefit from high floors and lovely views of the Singapore Straits and the Singapore Skyline. The Club lounge is lovely and spacious with snacks all day. Breakfast and evening canapÃ©s including alcoholic tipples make a truely great relaxing space. We were served by Shirley and Jacob, who were friendly, helpful and always ready top up what ever we needed. If you need a relaxing break, and some affordableâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Wow! Proactive concierge,Concierge Gaylen is proactive in understanding guest's expectations and needs. His many years of experience in the hotel industry has helped him greatly and the way he demonstrated the people and soft skills are exemplary to his peers. Good job,Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,3,Nice hotel but!!,"Lovely hotel and great location on the river walk in Singapore. Staff were friendly and rooms clean although the bathroom could do with an update. Only downside to our stay was that breakfast was chaos, the restaurant was worse than a motorway service cafe. Firstly they had run out of coffee cups and were giving guests paper cups instead and the food was in great need of replenishing as there were no pastries and the hot food counter was empty apart from baked beans and the poor man trying to keep up with eggs to order had a longer growing queue by the second. Guest were complaining at having to queue for eggs and by the time they got them all the hash browns etc were gone so they ended up with only eggs. As for us we ended up with coffee in a paper cup and a slice of bread andâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Sep-20,4,Conveniently located,Spent a few days here before boarding a cruise ship. The hotel was conveniently located for exploring the city. The room was certainly big enough for the four of us (2 adults and 2 children) and the bathroom was exceptionally clean.  The restaurant seemed reasonably priced although there were plenty of places to eat if you preferred. The â€˜friends cafeâ€™ was five minutes walk away and quite frankly nowhere was far in a taxi! We tended to pop to china town for dinner where there were lots of places to choose from and the busy atmosphere made dinning there a treat! Donâ€™t forget to look for the amazing street art on the buildings there!,Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Great Hospitality and Location,"I have been staying in this hotel for a few times. There are several things that I particularly like in this hotel. First, courteous services: hotel staff are not only providing great services, they are also so friendly and proactively approach guests. Particularly, I would like to thank Mary Jeow. I feel being an honor guest and well treated every time. Second, great location: this hotel is situated on the bank of Singapore river. There are tons of restaurants in the easy walking distance. I have no trouble at all to find different foods during my long business staying. Three, spectacular view: many rooms of this hotel provide excellent view of Singapore river and Marina bay in distance. Hotel staff always accommodated my request for those rooms and I thoroughly enjoyed it withâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,5,Singapore Holiday,"Excellent hotel for service and location. Walking distance to shopping centre - about 5 minutes and walking distance to all the restaurants in the Robertson, Clarke and Boat Quays precincts, Varies from approx. 7 minutes to 30 minutes. All along the river frontage also a large number of different food options. Staff always willing to assist. Hotel provides free internet service area and free laundry facilities all on the 5th floor.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,"Great Location, Excellent Service","We stayed at Grand Copthorne Waterfront after a Southeast Asia cruise.  Loved it!  The hotel is very conveniently located near numerous restaurants and bars that are within easy walking distance or a short cab ride away.  In 2021, a new MRT station will open right next door that will make the hotel even more convenient.  But, what really makes this hotel special is the attentive and friendly service.  I would highly recommend the Executive Club level rooms with the excellent service from Shirley Chng and her exceptional team of Nash, Yani, Jacob, and Yingwei.  Thank you all for making our visit so enjoyable!",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,Exceptional customer service,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning from an overnight flight. We were hoping to leave leave our bags and possibly use the pool until we could check in. The receptionist went well above this by not only finding a room we could check into (at 7 am!) but she also suggested we enjoy breakfast in the lobby restaurant while our bags were taken to the room. This was so welcome after a sleepless night travelling and so kind. We booked a club room which was fine and gave us access to the excec lounge for amazing views and complimentary snacks and drinks including a very tasty Prosecco. Beds are comfortable and rooms very quiet. For check out the excec lounge staff suggested we leave our bags with the concierge, use the pool and come to the lounge again later to relax before ourâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,May-20,5,A Beautiful Wedding,"The service exceeded expectations. Our manager, Serene, always remained contactable on WhatsApp for our last-minute queries. She also -allowed time and room for changes in our contract to suit our needs and wants. Â  Food was delectable. The-menus offered were good and the chef was receptive to food tasting reviews and feedback was taken into consideration. There were also novel items which were of good quality like the cheesecake dessert. Â  Our venue was spectacular. The Grand Ballroom decoration was extravagant with fairy lights and street lights. The table dÃ©cor choices all turned out very beautiful and the smoke machines turned out fine Â  Thank you making our wedding a wonderful and memorable one.",Nov-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Aug-20,5,Best and Breeziest Alfreco in Singapore!,"Who would have thought that this hotel has a hidden gem? Nothing can beat their alfresco dining.  Good view of the Singapore river and sightings of otters family and turtle if you get lucky.   Food is oustanding, we had the meat combo and I should commend the chef for preparing a mouth watering meat , it is beyond delicious!!!!! Decent red wine and prosecco during Thursday ladies night. The cheese platter is okay, but it would  be nice to be a little more generous with the prosciutto ðŸ˜…  We had a chat with the Hotel Manager Terrence, Assistant Manager Kelvin and the Restaurant Manager Ashley who are equally accomodating and gracious.   Special thanks also to Patrick and Shabarry  who  took good care of us for the rest of the night!  And guess what? it is Saturday and  I am backâ€¦",Aug-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,John,"Excellent experience. On arrival an upgrade was suggested which we took and it was well worthwhile - upgraded room on one of the top floors with wonderful views; use of the executive club which provided breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks and nibbles. Staff are lovely and helpful - thanks to Yani, Steven, Jacob and Ying. Would definitely stay there again.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,5,5 Star accommodation with staff to match!,"This visit was my first time to Singapore and I had booked at the Grand Copthorne based on a recommendation from a relative, I am so glad that I did.  My Mother was struck with a back injury shortly before the trip and she needed to use a mobility scooter on the holiday. From the moment we checked in we were treated so well.  Noticing that Mum had the mobility scooter, the staff at the front desk upgraded us to a 1 Bdrm suite so that there would be more room for her to maneuver and store the scooter in the room. We did not request or expect this upgrade but were very grateful.  I booked the Club room which gave us access to the club lounge in the hotel. We chose to eat breakfast as well as spend happy hour in the lounge as the staff were so lovely, they could not do enough forâ€¦",Nov-19,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,4,Conveniently located for central Singapore,"We arrived much earlier than check in because of our flight schedule but the hotel staff were lovely and accommodating.  We were able to leave our luggage in a waiting area upstairs and use the hotel pool while our room was prepared.  Then a member of staff (Qistina) came to find us in the pool area so that we could go to our room to rest.  There was a great choice of food for breakfast the next morning, although our son is gluten free and we couldn't find any specific GF food for him.  However, we managed as there was a good selection of fruit, yoghurt, eggs, etc.",Jan-20,,
Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Feb-20,5,Enjoyed our stay,"After our cruise itinerary being changed, we ended up staying back in Singapore for a few days which we were pleased about as we did not have the chance to do all we hoped prior to cruise.  Our cruise agent booked us into this hotel.  Lovely hotel, very friendly and helpful staff.  We had breakfast here on the second morning as we thought it was worth the money with all the different choices.  Day before we had breakfast at one of the local cafe's, very nice but if you wanted a few coffees cost mounted up so more economical to have breakfast at hotel especially with the fruit, make your own pancakes, cooked breakfast etc. Rooms were lovely and big.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Mar-20,3,First visit,"First impression as we pulled up in taxi wasn't great, it appered to be stuck in a built up area. Staff were helpful and polite. Unable to check in as we had arrived early, (Note to self make sure we book  an early check in while traveling next time.) The room was clean but some what dated, but did the job for a couple of nights. The water front location on the river bank and local restuarnts is very good, just a short walk  along the river and over a bridge, there are loads of resturants and pubs which all have happy hour, and meal deals, plus a few small local shops. We never tried the hotel food as the prices were high compared to what you could get just down the river side.  It was very easy to get a water ferry down to the marina bay area.

Grand Copthorne Waterfront,Jan-20,1,Very disappointing,After a fabulous cruise we were looking forward to a luxurious room with a bath in bathroom and all usual amenities for a supposedly five star hotel.  Instead we had a surly check-in guy completely disinterested. Waited three hours for room which is drab dirty and badly lit. On complaining we were told this was a deluxe room and the standard would be lower to have a bath!  We could pay to have an upgrade!! We took some milk and bottle of mineral water to room and were charged $42!!!!! Just to make a drink!  This has put a huge dampener on our once in a life time holiday. We have travelled through india and Sri Lanka where all the people we came accros were respectful and charming.  If you want to be looked after in Singapore Do not Stay At This Hotel!,Jan-20,,

The 'club' experience was really great. We were served complimentary afternoon tea each day and canopies and drinks every evening,in the Club Lounge. We were given a complimentary upgrade when we arrived, and the view from our room at night was breathtaking. We were also given complimentary laundry of 2 items a day, and the fridge was stocked with complimentary soft drinks! On check out which was done painlessly at the club lounge we were then given access to another lounge area with showers where if we wanted to freshen up before a late flight, we could.

First night lounge on 29th floor very good, wonderful view and service by Wing Yi was great. From Tuesday morning onwards, so called lounge area was roped off area behind bar with no view. When they said small amount of snacks would be provided they did not lie. Drink service was by the sole barman who was also serving all other guests in hotel dining area.

The hotel was in a great location within walking distance of Robinson Quay, where there are lots of restaurants and bars and around a 15 minute walk to Clarkes Quay.  Although there were a lot of attractions closed and overall Singapore was very quiet, we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely like to visit the hotel again when things return to normal thanks to the friendliness and kindness of Uzair, he is a credit to the hotel.",Mar-20,,

We arrive very early in Singapore and although we could not check in, the hotel had a residential lounge located on the 5th floor. Here we were able to have a much needed shower, change and relax after a long flight. The lounge had bottled water and the hotel staff provided us with very much needed extra strong coffee to start our day.  The hotel staff were kind enough to book us onto their Tiong Bahru tour on the same morning where we were given $5 each to spend on breakfast in the food hall. This was more than enough for us to buy a full breakfast with coffee and juice. The tour was also filled with lovely snacks and knowledge provided by a local guide. High recommend if you're there on a Saturday morning! â€¦",Sep-19,,

On both stays our spacious room had lovely views across the Singapore river. The hotel is very well situated on Robertson Quay with a bridge behind the hotel leading across the river to all the restaurants & cafes on the Quayside.  There was a regular shuttle to take us to the nearest MRT station or to Orchard Road. All of the staff at the hotel were very welcoming & helpful.

Compared to regular Food Courts in Singapore ( available normally in every 1 KM), the prices in these restaurants could be much higher ( 4 times atleast or more).

I like how every little comment were noted from my last review. A good example were the change of toilet paper in room, no more lousy cheap toilet paper you found in public toilets.   I requested to stay in different layout this time. Indeed different, but smaller. Very much smaller despite i notice slightly larger shower and basin area. Nevertheless, it is still a very good hotel room. Keep it up, Vagabond.   Disclaimer, I stayed here the week before Singapore Circuit Breaker.

Try the Whiskey Library!,"Stayed 1 Night at the hotel, which is located in a row of pre-WW2 shophouses at the southern end of Syed Alwi Road.  The hotel is packed with eclectic art works, sculptures and prints. At checkin, I was upgraded to the Courtyard Executive Room. Unfortunately all suites were sold out for the night.  The room had a 70's feel with dark woods, spacious and included a large work desk. My room had many windows and a large sliding door, bathing the room in natural light. The room had direct access to a small private courtyard shared with 4 other rooms.  The bed was comfy, good Wifi, cold AC, ample hot water. Standing shower only, no bathtub (apparently only found in the Vagabond Suite). The Executive Club Lounge served complimentary hors dâ€™oeuvres and standard pour drinks during the 3 hour long happy hour. The lounge converts to the Whiskey Bar & Restaurant at night. During our stay, the Yellow Pot pop-up restaurant from the Six Senses @ Duxton was whipping up Chinese food - expensive (by Syed Alwi Road prices) but large portions. The Whiskey Library has a very long list of rare and expensive labels from all over the world. Pro Tip: Order the Whiskey Flight to taste the best bottles at an affordable price. The highlight of the stay must be the excellent staff who served us throughout the stay. They were genuinely warm and very efficient. I asked the FD to lend me an umbrella as was it was pouring outside. She could have simply brushed me off by saying all brollys had been loaned out. But instead, she lent me her personal umbrella! Breakfast options comprised western and local fare, limited to 1 item per person, which I felt was unnecessarily stingy. That said, the servings were generous. Street side coupon parking only.

There were also no other guests so we had the courtyard to ourselves. Just a note, you will need to request for dental kit from the concierge if you don't see them. Also request for extra water bottles and they would come back to you quickly.   We had access to the Club Lounge which offered us quick bites and a wide range of alcoholic beverages.

However, the trip ended being filled with little disappointments.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a courtyard room. This was a lovely gesture. The room is quite small but was sufficient for our needs. It has a shared courtyard area but we didn't use it. The amenities were basic and we had to request toothbrushes from reception (and extra water as only two small bottles are provided). The bed was comfy and I liked that the TV had movies on demand.

The bathroom had nice products for showering. They also included two bottles of water.  The neighborhood around The Vagabond Club is very unique and we enjoyed exploring it.

It did not take long before the hotel replied to say that they could store it on its premises. I knew at that moment that I was in for a great stay.   The check-in process was smooth and quick, and whilst waiting for the room keys, I had the chance to check out the hotel lobby and restaurant, and they looked amazing.

We cashed in Marriott points and loved the location and staff. The room is small and there was a bit of a musty smell. Both were more than tolerable. Canâ€™t say enough for the staff. They allowed an early check-in after a very long flight and were always ready with great advice.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!,Jan-20,,

We tried the spice road, Charlie Chaplin style, time for love cocktails they were awesome. Their fried rice and szechuan chicken were scrumptious, the duck dish was tasteless, dry disappointing.

Breakfast which i bought ended up being for only 1 person when i indicated 2 of us were staying so i had to top up and it felt like a hidden cost.

The hotel design is unique and quirky, which we also appreciated, and breakfast dishes were pretty good. However:  - Rooms are very small and space is so tight that when you order room service, they can't roll a table to the room; they will simply hand you the tray from the other side of the door, it's that tight.   - Room service food was bland and disappointing; we expected more after enjoying the breakfast menu.  - Housekeeping was a bit of an issue for us: day after day there were small rubbish items on the floor that didn't get swept or hoovered (we observed these rubbish items and they literally stayed putâ€¦",Feb-20,,

Itâ€™s definitely stylish and has lots of character, everything from the room style to the unique check-in design. However we just felt something was lacking. While the hotel hard product has personality, the staff and extras let this place down. At this small boutique hotel they have the chance to impress and give some personality - they didnâ€™t and it never really shone through. Check in was very sterile and we were given the rules straight away â€œno check in before 3 and as Gold Elite we can honor your late check outâ€.

The little touches were what made our experience special.  From the welcome bowl ritual (you have to do it if you visit!), to the small chime at our bedside table, to the glass bottles in the room to eradicate single-used plastic bottles (they bottle their water on-site!), to the herb garden by the pool and the social library that serves as a reading and eating area... these make this hotel really special.   The staff also surprised us with a bottle of wine and cake in our room for our wedding anniversary, which we enjoyed on our first evening.   The staff were all attentive, polite and clearly took pride in working in this quaint heritage hotel. Thank you for having us!",Mar-20,Travelled as a couple,
"Maxwell Reserve Singapore, Autograph Collection",Feb-20,3,"Great location, but not on-par with Six Senses standards","The Six Senses Maxwell is, overall, a good hotel, but is quite a let down knowing the high standards associated with the brand.  The design of the public areas in the hotel is beautiful: with its restaurant set in a library and the building's colonial feel situated in a small street not too far from Chinatown is very charming. The check-in was swift and professional (even though I arrived late in the evening), but lacking: for example, none of the facilities offered by the hotel was presented to me.  The room was unfortunately very small and very gloomy due to a lack of lighting. You could tell that the furniture were worn out and not very well tended to, as they were dusty and old.  Even though all of the things mentioned above are not THAT big of a deal, I would not expect that from a Six Senses. But this leads me to the most disappointing thing: the service, that is really not at all to the expectation of the brand.  The restaurant, even though very nice, is not properly staffed as I waited more than 40 mins for an order of eggs benedict. On top of that, too few waiters lead to less than average service, as the staff was overwhelmed with orders (even though the restaurant was not full) and I had to wave a few times to finally get attention to order coffee. Also, one thing that I did not really understand is that complimentary breakfast with the room rate only gets you one dish even though the room is for 2pax... If I had traveled with somebody else I would have had two dishes, while since I was traveling alone I could only order one dish (nevertheless paying the same rate). Finally, check-out was not a great experience, as the person at the lobby decided to take a guest that arrived after me... wasn't late to anything so didn't say anything, but didn't really understand.â€¦",Nov-19,,
"Maxwell Reserve Singapore, Autograph Collection",Jan-20,5,Characterful Property and Room,"Well located close to Chinatown and with the character missing from so many modern hotels, we enjoyed our stay here. The room was extremely clean, well appointed and decorated and the public rooms very comfortable and welcoming. The downside is that our room was on the small side and if you have more than one case, you will find the only place to put the second case is on the floor. In the prior information, we had requested a quiet room and then allocated a room next to the elevator. We were told that if we wanted a quiet room then we would need to pay extra for a larger room. We declined and whilst we were disturbed by guests using the elevator, the biggest disturbance came from the hotels' own staff - room service staff talking noisily outside our room at 7 a.m. The other minor niggle was the poor breakfast service. Whilst there was no shortage of staff to take your order for the rather expensive drinks or food in the bars, the hotel management did not give the same priority to serving breakfast where the too few staff worked tremendously hard. We would like to stay here again and hope that the deficiencies described above will have been sorted by then.â€¦",Jan-20,,
"Maxwell Reserve Singapore, Autograph Collection",Jan-20,5,Beautiful hotel in amazing location,"I recently stayed at the Six Senses Maxwell for two nights, and had the best experience! The hotel is gorgeous, and feels quite authentic as it combines multiple old shop buildings and blends in beautifully to the Singapore landscape. As with all Six Senses, the food was amazing - as was the service and general vibe of comfortable luxury. The multiple bar areas in the lobby as well as the library and pool area are extremely beautiful and comfortable to relax in. We also went to the Duxton property for breakfast one morning, which I couldnâ€™t recommend more - it is super unique and impeccably designed. The Six Senses location in Chinatown is also perfect - directly across the street from the Maxwell hawker stands and close to the vibrant restaurant and nightlife scene in Chinatown, while remaining a serene escape once inside the building. Six senses will never disappoint, and it was great to spend time in their Singapore locations!â€¦",Jan-20,Travelled with family,
Resorts World Sentosa - Crockfords Tower,Nov-20,5,For a safe staycation,"It has been almost 2 years since we last stayed at this hotel and were happy to be back again. Glad to see that they had the necessary Covid 19 safety check processes in place. These were positioned at the entrance to the hotel and as well at the lift lobby. They have even put up a perplex screen at the reception counter to minimise contact between guests and staff. Rooms are cleaned and sanitized after each set of guests checked out. Daily cleaning of room is still being carried out. Stay was comfortable and requests for amenities, etc were quickly attended to. Although the  room was generally clean, did notice that some of the furniture were stained and perhaps due for replacement? Another area which hotel management could possibly look into is the check-in time. We did not get a room until almost 4 pm although we were there before 12 pm to do the checking in. Apparently, rooms cleaning took a longer time due to smaller number of staff.â€¦",Nov-20,,
Resorts World Sentosa - Crockfords Tower,Aug-20,3,Not as excellent as I expect but overall ok,A little disappointed when I reached Crockford ..  Not up to what I expect for this hotel  The butler service is not very responsive  Service is super duper slow  Need to call many times before action is being taken  Maybe they are very busy or short handed   But the room is ok ..  due to covid a lot of things are being removed   Therefore itâ€™s just like a normal hotel room just that itâ€™s more spacious ...

Staffs were truly attentive and knowledgeable. Check in by multiligual gentleman Kesevan and escorted to my beautiful quarters by Frances who oriented me on the facilities of my room. The concierge man Azli brought my luggages to my room almost after I stepped into the room......he was fast. Other hotels I have been to luggages take almost 10 to 15 minutes to arrive.  I have to commend Rick from Housekeeping and his staff they were fast in ensuring every request I made was delivered or attended to.....I was wondering if they were genies appearing at my door with a flick of a finger. My room was well maintained and clean. Housekeeping really takes their job seriously. In other hotels this kind of service you get only if you are royalty or rich. Staffs always went out of their way to ensure I was enjoying my stay. Irene recommended me ESPA to unwind and it was the best thing I did. I wish I could eat and eat as there was just too many dining options available and so little time for me. End of my stay and checking out Penny and Chin handle my checkout like they just would not want me to leave, well if you ask me I dis not want too but we all have to work.....I am certainly going to let my networks know of this royal place to stay and meet the staffs who will make their stay great. â€¦",Feb-20,Travelled as a couple,
Resorts World Sentosa - Crockfords Tower,Nov-20,1,Terrible value and not wonderful rooms,"Rooms and premises of the hotel were not well maintained. The room was damp and musty such that you could feel that the bed sheets were damp as well. There was also an unpleasant smell in the room when we first checked in. I was horrified and disgusted to see lots of dust under both TVs. We used the pool and noted mould at some of the walls as well. The pool was also pretty small. Overall, not a kid's friendly hotel from the cleanliness issue and the size of the pool.   This is supposed to be the most luxurious hotel under RWS but the service was anything but that. Upon arrival in a taxi, there was no one to help with the door nor luggage. Approaching the hotel, not a single staff to greet you nor direct you to the check in counter. None of the service staff left an impression at all as service was just cold and impersonal. Supposed to have a butler service as I've read in previous reviews but no butler came to introduce themselves.   If you're looking for a luxurious and pampering treat please try Shangri La or Ritz-Carlton. You'll definitely get more bang for your buck. This is just an expensive hotel with no service nor amenities to back up the price. The only thing it has going for it is probably the location but I guess you could go for Hotel Michael at half the price. â€¦",Nov-20,Travelled with family,

Every food recommended by him liked by my kids. He was so friendly towards my kids too and know what best for them.

I normally do not like 'shophouse' or 'boutique hotels' but the property manages to make me forget that. Everything in this hotel was properly curated right down to the welcome drink at check-in and the room amenities. I wanted to walk around Tanjong Pagar after checking in but end up staying all day inside my room as it was really comfortable (although on the smaller side).

The library is very well stocked and organized by topics especially related to botanic, exploration and nature. Checkout their infusions at the bar counter, its a neat place.  Food and beverage selection, was good, presentation could need some minor improvements and service needs direction and supervision.

They actually told us they donâ€™t provide wine glasses till a 2nd call was made to them.  Hot water for the bathtub wasnâ€™t working and they cannot get back to us on the status even though we left the hotel for close to 5 hours. They blame it on the shift change which I felt is transparent to us. We just wanted a working hot bathtub.  For the reviews seen on TripAdvisor on how their butler service and 5 stars service.

The Outpost Hotel Sentosa by Far East Hospitality,Mar-20,5,"Small Luxury Hotel, but Big Surprise","This hotel is part of the Village Hotel Sentosa complex, with certain shared facilities, associated with Small Luxury Hotels.  The Outpost is a nice hotel, priced affordably with lots of nice little touch. The room is not huge but immaculately designed and created. You can either have pool view or Sea View, pricing may vary for each room category.  It comes with a choice of snacks, you can choose 5 items at the reception ranging from chips, to drinks, mints, energy bars and nuts and they will then place in a metal basket and deliver to your room. It has a Nespresso machine in the room with 4 capsules, specially curated tea leaves and the coveted Apelles bathroom amenities. It is a little eco friendly where no plastic water bottles in the room but a filtered water tap instead.  The swimming pool is the highlight spanning from kids pool with slides to Adventure Pool, Lazy River to Pamukkale Pool overlooking the sea. It sits on a huge acres of land with many greens as well. I wish they can redesign the landscape a little to add on more sun loungers, many were turned away (walked away) as they could not find a spot to lounge in.  This pool is a shared facility with Village Hotel Sentosa. However, The Outpost has another Sky Pool perched atop called V:U. it is a ""beach club/day club"" concept run and managed separately by 1 Group. The view is nice up there overlooking Palawan, Tg Beach and also the hotel's gorgeous pool complex on level 3. The service provided at this premise can be a little ""seamless"" in my opinion, but generally you get additional perks to stay at this beautiful hotel.  There were some activities arranged by the hotel eg Yoga and Flower Arrangements. We learned how to make a hand bouquet, it was both fun and educational.  The customer service of the hotel is definitely one of the highlights from Reception to Concierge ... particularly Sashi and Duty Manager Eddie.

We were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary sea view upgrade and whilst the room isn't big, the flood of natural light and deco make it feel spacious. In room drinking water filter was a nice touch and we enjoyed the Appelles bath products. Like many guests, we loved the concept of choosing our own minibar items. Room service was quite pricey but that encouraged us to visit the hotel restaurants and food at both Native Kitchen and V:U were wonderful. At V:U, we overheard some of the full time crew express their annoyance at the part-timers (who were quite untrained & didn't know how to adequately attend to guests); perhaps management could look into this before deploying part-time crew especially during busy periods as the service level can be quite jarring. â€¦",Jan-20,Travelled as a couple,

The Outpost Hotel Sentosa by Far East Hospitality,Jan-20,5,Away from home,"Thereâ€™s something so cosy about this place.At the same time you can feel itâ€™s exclusiveness. I came here to celebrate my birthday and it felt so close to home. Check in was breezy thanks to lovely receptionist Darwisya who helped us picked out our complimentary gift items upon check in. I was so surprised they upgraded my room as the manager Trisya realised it was my birthday celebration and Ms. Wei Yan for giving me an extra allowance to check out in my birthday as I really like this place on my first visit. Thank you girls for making my birthday a memorable one! The pool was spacious and great with the view of the harbour, it was a great idea to the hotel to separate the pool from the children as we adults sometimes want to lounge in peace.  The area is close to every attraction so no issues about that, breakfast spread is great but unfortunately thereâ€™s another pool area that they have not opened. Will come again and try that soon once they are opened.  My favourite part is the shower where everything is so futuristic, you press the button for either the rain shower or the shower head, they have a nice bidet too which is actually most important for most asians like me.  Overall and enjoyable stay, thank you!â€¦",Jan-20,,

The staff here are all so friendly and helpful, from reception to housekeeping, nothing is too much trouble. On arrival in our room we were greeted with a yummy cake, a gift and heart shaped balloons on our very comfy bed.  The entire hotel is so clean, the warm toilet seat and inbuilt bidet something different, the shower very roomy and the filtered water tap a bonus.  The family swimming pools shared with The Village Hotel are set in a relaxing atmosphere and the rooftop pool is for adults only.

All I can say is I'm extremely impressed with the staff at The Outpost. Hospitality at its best!!! Sarah at the hotel was welcoming, friendly and extremely attentive. Wei Yan was also a delight to have, especially smooth check-in and thank you for the lovely surprises :) it was really above and beyond what we expected! Kudos to the amazing team at the Outpost for making our stay such a memorable one! Thanks for helping us build such precious memories! Would definitely come back and stay with you guys again!  Another thing that's truly commendable about the Outpost is their dedication to saving our planet, you won't find bottled water but instead a premium filtered drinking tap instead. Their Siloso Night tea is really a delight too - I've been trying to Google where to get them but it seems like it was curated specially for the hotel only :) hope I get to buy them sometime soon! â€¦",Feb-20,Travelled with family,
The Outpost Hotel Sentosa by Far East Hospitality,Feb-20,4,"Convenient location, good service, Value for money","This hotel was opened in Apr 2019.  Itâ€™s a cluster of hotels consists Village Hotelï¼ŒThe Barracks and The Outpost.  You have to drive past Village Hotel Lobby to get to the entrance where a very friendly hotel staff stationed there happily greeted us and sent us to Lobby @ Level 3.  Checked in was smooth with welcome drink - fruit juices served while we were waiting for the staff to complete the check in.  Then we were brought to refreshments bars stocked with breakfast bars, nuts, chips, juices etc to select 5 items. Though we arrived at 12noon, we were allowed to check in before the official check in time @3pm.    Our room overlooking 3rd floor common pools was small but compact.  We love the Nespresso Machine, filtered water drinking tap, Appelles toiletries and the Japanese toilet bidet. The gyms & pools at Level 3 are shared facilities with Village hotel.  There is a smaller pool at Level 7 but not as nice. Gym was average with mostly treadmills, weights equipment.  Outpost is 5 mins walk from RWS, Impian station, Universal studio.  There is free shuttle to Vivo City at half hour interval. The free shuttle Bus A,B,C which takes you to different parts of Sentosa is just outside of Village Hotel.

Our Housekeeper, Mdm Gim Geok, deserves a special shout out. Her warm and pleasant personality is something we will miss. Our apartment is always in an immaculate condition when we return. During our length of stay, she made effort to engage us, get to know us and our dogs. Coming back to the floor whenever Mdm Gim is on shift is always a warm and welcoming experience.  The staff at the breakfast table are also an excellent team. They made the effort to remember guests and greet with warm smiles even when the restaurant was running full at times. The toiletries, towels, kitchenware & equipment, audio & entertainment system, bedding provided were of good quality and this made our stay even more comfortable and cosy.

The Outpost Hotel Sentosa by Far East Hospitality,Feb-20,5,Amazing Hotel,"We were looking for a hotel on Sentosa for a birthday celebration and chanced upon The Outpost. The price was pretty reasonable considering the other hotel in the vicinity. Upon check in, we were warmly welcomed by Zoey, she upgraded my room to a sea facing one considering that we were celebrating birthday there.  We were also served with a mocktail while we check in. Zoey also introduced us to a complimentary painting class held by the hotel which we had a blast taking part in it.   Part of their unique guest experience was that guests will choose 5 snacks as part of their mini bar. It definitely elevates the guest experience as the snacks looks pretty premium. Will definitely recommend getting the Starbucks chocolate drink.  Their room was aesthetically pleasing. I love the fact that the room have a fountain providing filtered tap water. The room also have complimentary nespresso for guests to enjoy.  When we checked out the next day, we were helped by Shafiq at the reception. When we mentioned that we absolutely love their toiletries, he offered to give us a few bottles to bring back home. This is absolutely top notch customer service offered by The Outpost Hotel.  I would definitely visit the hotel again! 100/100 for the hotel!  Big kudos to Zoey and Shafiq for their outstanding customer service. We briefly mentioned to Zoey about the dinner we have to attend after the art class and she was there to remind us to leave for the dinner!â€¦",Mar-20,,

However, the weekend stay-cation experience exceeded my expectation and I'm still reminiscing the great time.   We were pleasantly surprised by the check-in experience. In a cozy lobby, we were greeted by warm personalities like Eddie Tan and Zoey Too who brighten up the morning with fast and gentle check-in procedures of temperature checks and travel declaration.  Eddie Tan (Guest Experience Manager) was professional, cheerful and attentive to details in our needs, while Zoey was efficient and gave us the sweetest smile to set us off in a delightful mood for the holiday.   The room is luxurious with quality fixtures and amenities, that left us feeling pampered (the quality coffee, wonderful pillows, toilet etc.).  Service staff to the room to bring us a comb was cheerful and warm!  Can't forget the joyful staff who greeted us at carpark entrance and breakfast place!  Oh and the breakfast was fantastic, totally beyond my expectation! Hotel breakfast is seldom something I look out for, but this breakfast could well be one of the main reasons for my next stay!  Location of the hotel cannot be any better.  Short walk to the Universal Studio, dining, and beaches.â€¦",Mar-20,,

The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,4,Nice hotel - not for families,"Westin Singapore:  Now this is an interesting post as my husband and I had different opinions on this hotel.  We booked a 3 night luxury escapes deal for $999 which included breakfast daily, access to the club lounge, afternoon drinks & snacks and a 3 course meal at cook and brew for 2 adults.   Check in was on the 32nd floor of the Asia Square building number 2. This area is where all of the business people would go and I think the hotel is much better suited to them rather than families.   The Downtown MRT is across the road a short walk away. Raffles Place MRT is also close by near La Pau Sat where we love to eat.  The staff were all lovely at the hotel, but very sterile with almost no character about them. This was the thing I judged the hotel on the most as we have just stayed at 3 hotels prior who all went above and beyond to interact and talk to everyone.   The room itself was beautiful with marble in the bathroom, a rainshower and normal shower, a spacious bath tub, 2 double beds, minibar which they nicely cleared out for us as you get charged as someone picks something up, large cupboard and complimentary bottles of water.  There was a small view between all the highrises to Marina Bay area and our room looked down over the pool.   Breakfast was at Seasonal Tastes which had a full buffet spread of salads, meats, cereals, pastries, fruit, juices, asian and western to pick from.   The club was highly rated by my husband who doesnt mind an alcoholic beverage, I did not rate it all all compared to other hotels with club access. Between 5:30pm and 7:30pm you can join the club for snacks of desserts, hot food, cured meats, cheeses and drinks - alcoholic and non alcoholic. Kids are not allowed inside but there is tables just outside dedicated to families which is located by the pool. You could eat enough here instead of going out for dinner.   Cook & Brew was an interesting restaurant where the staff were that little bit more naturally pleasant. It was quite a dark restaurant which made me sleepy. The kids had a couple of choices on a kids menu which came with ice cream for S$18++. We had 4 entrees, 4 mains and 2 desserts to pick from. If you arent a seafood eater the choices were more limited.  We picked the pad thai fries, pork belly noodles and a sundae. I enjoyed the meal but it was nothing that blew me away. The sundae especially was quite poor for a fancy restaurant - 1 teaspoon of crushed biscuits, 2 scoops of ice cream, slithered almonds and a cherry on top.   I wouldnt stay here again but I would reccomend it to people travelling without kids.â€¦",Jan-20,Travelled with family,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,4,Truly a luxury escape!,"My partner and I spent three nights at the Westin as part of a luxury escapes deal and we certainly found that this hotel was definitely a luxurious place in which to escape! Our room was very spacious, with a separate bathroom which featured a free standing bath. The bed was enormous, with fine quality linen and our room overlooked the pool area. Our deal included a daily breakfast and it was one of the best buffet breakfasts I have encountered, with a wide range of Western, Asian and healthy options. The egg station was manned by an extremely cheerful lady and even featured eggs benedict, as well as the more usual offerings of omelettes, poached and fried eggs made to order. The pastries were wonderful and there was even a small oven which contained heated croissants and rolls: delicious!  We also received access to the Club lounge as part of the deal and enjoyed the early evening sessions which featured a wide range of alcohol choices as well as a small buffet, featuring sweet and savoury options and a large bowl of prawns which was frequently replenished. The staff here were very welcoming and looked after all our needs quietly and efficiently. The pool area was quite small but the infinity type pool was stunning and we had no problem getting a lounger when we ventured down. The only negatives of our stay were: 1. It is quite difficult to find the hotel if you are unfamiliar with its exact location: my partner made his way there on the MRT after travelling from the golf and got lost as he did not know which exit to take from the MRT station. 2. It is in the business area so there is not a lot happening in the area in the evening, although La Pau Sat is within walking distance if you like street food and the proximity of the downtown MRT makes it easy to access other more interesting areas. 3. We had problems with the signal strength on the TV which meant it sometimes cut out - not a huge problem as we were often out and about but frustrating when we wanted to catch the news or golf. 4. Our room wasn't serviced until after 4 one day which was disconcerting to find after a full day out. Upon inquiring, we were told that rooms were often serviced until around 5! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay in this hotel and hope to return one day!â€¦",Jan-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Oct-20,5,A good hotel and a good location,"A staycay at the Marriott Tang Plaza. The check in was smooth and no fuss, and within minutes we got our key. Being a Marriott Bonvoy Elite member, we were upgraded to a better room category. The View from the room was a good one, overlooking the Scotts Square, Shaw Centre and Ion Orchard. Pretty cool to look out the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road/Scotts Road.  The hotel sits atop of the Tangs Department Store. One of the locals favourites. The hotel is also connected with underpass hence you are able to hop from malls to malls without getting wet or under the hot sun. It is also connected directly to the MRT (Subway) Orchard Station. This hotel is probably the best location in the entire Singapore in terms of strategic location, accessibility and connectivity.   The room is very new, completely refurbished including the bathroom. I really love the newness of the room as opposed to some hotels, a ""soft refurbishment"", a mixture of old and new.   There is no power socket/USB or charging station next to the bed which is kind of weird for a city corporate hotel. Even leisure hotels are equipped with the convenience. The TV is quite far from the bed due to the odd size of the room, albeit spacious.   The bathroom layout is functional and bright. The water pressure in the shower stall was good, with Thann bathroom amenities for you to indulge in a good shower.  The swimming pool at the 5th level is quite huge given this hotel focuses on corporate business segment as opposed to leisure. There were enough sun loungers plus a couple of huge poolside cabanas. There are also a few villas on the same deck as well.  Generally it is a good 5 star hotel, great location and we had a nice stay.â€¦",Sep-20,Travelled with friends,
The Westin Singapore,Feb-20,5,Very pleased with this choice of hotel,"Good location in CBD, five minutes from the excellent Lau Pa Sat hawker centre and also five minutes from a MRT stop. We didnâ€™t use the MRT however, choosing to walk where practical, the Marina Bay area is only 10-15 minutes away, or taking metered and very cheap taxis. Excellent views of either the harbour or Marina Bay areas from bedrooms and the glass fronted bath and shower areas are very novel.  Bedrooms are a good size and  are very well equipped. Service was excellent, staff were happy for us to use the very pleasant infinity pool and shower facilities to change several hours after we had checked out to accommodate our late flight.  Breakfast gave a broad range of choices to a very high standard.  I got an excellent room rate including breakfast and free Singapore Slings by booking through their website directly Canâ€™t fault it.â€¦",Feb-20,Travelled as a couple,
The Westin Singapore,Feb-20,4,A few days in Singapore,"As a Lifetime Titanium BonVoy member, I often choose to stay at a Bonvoy property.  Luckily Singapore offers a great selection!  The Westin Singapore is near the financial district/Marina Bay Area but still offers easy access (walking, taxi, public transportation) to a lot of destinations.  Access to the hotel was a bit of a chore with some local construction, however, once you arrive, you head up to the lobby level for check in, and you are greeted by the top notch service so many of the hotels in SE Asia offer.  With an early morning arrival, our room was not quite ready.  The staff were very accommodating and stored our bags, then provide up with access to the Westin Club Lounge where we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  The lounge really has a lot to offer.  Within an hour our suite was ready. Nice upgrade! Clean, spacious, extensive room service menu, and a beautiful view.  the pool and fitness facilities are also very good.  Overall, this is a great property, with excellent service, and offers great value.  Between the Westin Singapore or the W Singapore you can't go wrong.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to anyone.â€¦",Jan-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Dec-20,2,Inflexible and inconsistent enforcement of dress code at M club lounge,"Was nearly barred entry into the lounge as I was wearing a pair of $100+ Birkenstock shoes, which Ai Ling at the M club reception considered to be â€˜sandalsâ€™. I had worn this same pair of shoes to other hotel lounges (ritz Carlton and mandarin oriental etc) and never encountered any issue. I was also almost practically asked to go home to grab a pair of shoes to cover up my (shameful) toes as the lounge didnâ€™t have any to lend me (as what Tower Club which has a decidedly strict dress code would do) and I did not pack any other shoes for the stay as this dress code for the lounge was not communicated to me prior to the stay. Not sure why the hotel would choose to move the M club to beside the swimming pool (and former location of the very informal pool grill), and yet impose such an uptight dress code beside such a relaxing setting. The worst thing was that the dress code enforcement seemed disproportionately focused on footwear, and other guests clearly in gym attire (t-shirt and shorts) were let into the lounge without issue. Lastly, Ai Ling should really walk the talk as her own footwear was not entirely proper either - other staff at the lounge were wearing proper black court shoes but she was wearing a pair of off-colored grey shoes. In the end, my husband had to come down to give me his pair of shoes while he walked back to the room barefoot (not sure how it is within basic decency to allow any guest to go through this extent of trouble). The room and cocktails were great, but with so many excellent hotel options around, an incident as unpleasant as such is enough to ensure that this would be a hotel that I would likely never return to. â€¦",Dec-20,Travelled with family,
The Westin Singapore,Mar-20,4,Great,"Before reading this review, remember that my eye sight is extremely bad and I am too lazy to put on my glasses, so I'm just going to describe how the staff looks like. :)  During my first visit, a couple of weeks ago, I had an amazing service from the front desk. The lady who checked me in (I think it's the manager, she has the letters I, A, and Y in her name), anticipated all my needs (late checkout, bigger room, double bed, more amenities, etc). It was really crazy how intelligent this lady is. There were 2 other ladies who were also at the front desk who smiled and wished me a pleasant stay even though they had they own work to do, which I though was really amazing.   During my second visit, it was a different group of people at the front desk. The service was good but different from my first experience. I went down a few hours later to request for a late checkout, and the lady behind the desk said ""I can give you a late checkout, just this time"". That kinda felt weird.   Went to Seasonal Tastes for lunch (21 March). Every single one of them are amazing there. The manager at the reception was fantastic. The two other ladies that were working that shift were on point with their service. One of the ladies went around to make sure all the water glasses are filled up. The plates were cleared very quickly. The food was not bad. Very little options but I'm glad there were many options for vegetarians. The guy working at the dessert counter was fantastic. I can't describe how amazing he was with all the guests. He was just really happy to be there.  -ROOM- The room is obviously fantastic. Love everything about the room. The only thing is, it's kinda hard to work the bluetooth function in the room. It requires a code and the front office don't know either.   It took about 10 mins before I could reach the service express because I think they might have accidentally pressed their speaker button on, so I was just hearing their own conversations for a while before someone answered.   The requests from the Bonvoy app were sent to the room very quickly.â€¦",Mar-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Sep-20,3,It was good at the start...,"During the seamless checked in, everything was perfect from deluxe king to executive king room with the high floor request granted. Phyllis was helpful with my 1.30pm late check out request.   The room itself is spacious and decent.  Things went wrong when I lifted up the toilet  cover to see some stains on the seat.  Next was the remote control at the bedside kinda dusty. And missing the in room dining menu book. The room has slight mouldy smell.  The bedroom slippers quality was bad too.  The Marriott Bonvoy app assisted me to place my in room dining order.   The cod fish & chips was the most bland and not worth the money $36++.  The presentation of the in room dining do not comes with salt & pepper.  Okay so the next morning I have decided to order the in room dining again.   The American breakfast $35++.  All the dishes are covered except my apple juice & hot chocolate were left open when they were sent over.   Scrambled eggs can be skipped. No salt and pepper provided too.  Okay finally to check out. Was checking through my bill. There was an additional charge of omelette though the breakfast comes along with 2 choices of eggs as i ordered 1 omelette and 1 scrambled. Was showing my order messages in the app to the staff assisting with my check out. While running through, I realised my pork saus age was missing and didn't serve it to me. I quickly refer to the photo I had taken in the morning to confirm.  The staff quickly apologised on the missing sausage and adjusted the extra omelette charge. But no further initiative for the missing sausage.   Though i had spent $190 in total for the in room dining with alcohol and sparkling water too. I felt it was not well spent.   Please work on the house keeping and in room dining orders.   So my stay was pretty average. â€¦",Sep-20,Travelled solo,

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Dec-20,2,Poor experience,"Booked a room under Club Marriot weekend rates. Requested for early check in  at 11am but and arrived at 1pm but rooms were only ready at around 2pm which was understandable as it was a busy weekend. Tried to paid to upgrade to a room with bathtub but reception informed that none was available as all were reserved for elite members. The first room (2006) that was given was in a worn out and bad shape, it was extremely dusty along the edges and my nose started to itch. We even found hair and leftover nut crumbs from previous guests on the floor! Service desk sent up housekeeping to attempt to do a dusting but we went down to reception to request for a change of room. It was crowded at reception and extremely difficult to get anybody's attention. Finally got a staff to escalate a room change but was told that we would have to wait till evening. We accepted this and went for a swim instead. At around 630pm, we were finally given a new room (2803) which looked alot better. An anniversary cake was sent up which was thoughtful but we were out during delivery. Surprisingly, there was no cover on the cake and it was just left in the open. This is extremely unhygienic and unexpected especially during the covid period.  Staff offered a dining credit as a slight recovery which was a good gesture but first impression was already not good. Breakfast the next morning was an awful experience. We entered the restaurant at 1010am, and placed out order at 1015am, but food was not served to us until around 1050am. What was shocking was despite us constantly checking with the staff, they just kept saying will check with kitchen and we had to further wait, even though those who came behind us already got served their food before us. The staff even tried to ask us for our last orders when our first orders have not arrived. The food that finally arrived was disappointing too. The eggs benedict was overly cooked like boiled eggs instead, while the other sweet items like waffle and pancakes were dry and cold.   As a five star international chain, such experiences that boiled down to the basics is certainly extremely unpleasant.â€¦",Dec-20,,

A Chinese man wearing a suit and tie insisted we had to eat at a small corner behind the Java+ cafe counter, where plenty of people were crammed in.

I informed the team at Marriott Tang about this and they must really have wanted me to succeed because they upgraded me to the Tang Sok Kiar Suite at no extra charge :) :)  The Tang Sok Kiar Suite came with:  - a spacious living room - your very own private pool (big enough to swim laps) - an outdoors pavilion (ideal for romantic engagement shots) - a kitchen with a huge fridge (for your celebratory champagne and cake after a successful proposal) - a huge bathtub with a TV in case you want to Netflix & soak  The team at Marriott Tang also very kindly allowed my friends to decorate the room for the proposal while we were away (they even helped out too).

As a platinum member, I was immediately upgraded to a 1BR Suite on the 28th floor without asking. It came with expansive views of the Orchard/Scotts Roads. The suite had a separate living and bedroom. The living room had a power room with WC, a large desk and a very comfy sofa. The ensuite toilet was large with 2 sinks, a bathtub and a separate shower area. The bedroom was large with its own walk-in wardrobe.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Jan-20,1,GLORY DAYS.... PAST MANY YEARS AGO,"Having stayed at Marriott properties for the past 25 years, brand loyalty has been very important to me. I have been very complimentary and written glowing emails to the management of properties when the service has been exemplary.   However, with the Marriott Tang Plaza.... this is definitely not the case.    For so many years, this was a showcase property and worthy of the room rates that they charge.  However, as my title says.... the Glory days have definitely passed.   The condition of the room was rather substandard compared to what I have been accustomed to when staying at JW Marriott properties.  There was no Welcome amenity. The room showed evidence of mold. Excessive flooding around the shower because of inadequate rubber molding.  The Toilet amenities were againâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Jan-20,5,Five Star Stay,"So many things I want to share about the Marriott Tang Plaza after a week long stay. The location is perfect for business and tourism as it sits on top of the Orchard MRT station - so anywhere is close by using public transport. It is, of course, also in the heart of shopping which was fun and helpful the week before Christmas. Taking a Grab ride from the airport is around 30 minutes in evening rush hour, less during the very early morning.  The hotel leaves nothing to be desired - restaurants catering to various tastes, a decent gym and pool. The lobby was inviting but during afternoon tea, is very crowded and there is often nowhere to sit.   The sleeping rooms are clean and well equipped with lots of outlets/USB connections.

As an old guard on Orchard Road with an iconic architecture, I was pleasantly surprised to find it refreshingly up-to-date and well maintained. For a start, we were upgraded to their Tang Sok Kiar Suite (I booked an executive suite), which was tucked behind a row of pool terrace rooms. The seclusion, in addition to offering privacy and a sense of exclusiveness, also had the added advantage of a dip pool in a private courtyard. Who could ask for more in a city hotel? The only downside to this is the unsheltered walk along the side of the pool deck to the suite. We also enjoyed happy hour at the Executive Lounge.

We were excited to try out the Marriott property.  So at check-in, I saw a lug queue of 6 people in front of me, and there was just 1 lady badly staffed attending to guests.

I kept calling the concierge asking for my luggage.  Their wonton noodle soup is tasteless. Its like food for the sick. Their spaghetti was â€œokayâ€ their presentation was not close to a 5 star presentation. The break looks pathetic. The elevator is also very slow despite staying at the 8 floor.

As much as I keep trying to not let one incident contaminate what was otherwise a great stay this keeps bothering me.  My last day (Saturday the 15th), I went into the M lounge in my Grey leather sandals Khaki shorts and a nice collared shirt.

How often does one have the chance for an aerial view of the famouse shopping belt in all its glory. However, the quality of service and food at the executive lounge and the lobby cafe left much to be desired. I suspect that many male servers are staff who had been redeployed, and are either not properly trained or not good match for the role. At the executive lounge, food was served without cutlery and we had to ask for napkins.

He did his best to accommodate my request on that day and I really appreciate his efforts. And after I checked in and occasionally bumped into Mr. Mil at the lobby, he was able to recognise me and greeted me remembering my surname despite the numerous people he checked-in in a day.  I personally think his service is impeccable and applaud him for that. Thank you so much Marriott for having an amazing staff in your team.",Oct-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Oct-20,1,Good hotel but poor service,"I would like to mention how utterly disappointed I am with Marriott Tang Plaza Hotelâ€™s customer service. I came here today for an evening swim. Judy, a club receptionist approached us at the poolside for my membership card. She deliberately mentioned that she needed to keep my membership card, therefore I passed it to her as I do not want to further argue. She also spoke in a rude manner saying she would cancel my membership card. Who is she to cancel my membership card? I felt insulted as a customer. It is not about the money, it is the way you interact with your customers! Her lack of sincerity threw me off, as she added on to her last sentence â€œI will bear any consequences, please let the company know.â€ Is this how hoteliers to talk to their customers? I would not accept suchâ€¦",Oct-20,,

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Jan-20,4,A very good stay if you like shopping,"I have stayed in many hotels in Singapore from Orchard Road to Marina Bay and Sentosa.  I found that I have been staying at Marriott Tangs most regularly as my other half loves shopping.  Marriott is located in the famous shopping district Orchard Road and is literally a stone throw away from the MRT subway system.  The location is fantastic & hard to beat. The rooms are *quiet and bed is super comfy. Front desk services are impeccable & good restaurants to wet oneâ€™s appetite.  The only reason why I did not give it full points is because they are currently doing some renovations at the top floors & can be a bit noisy occasionally.  *If you want a quiet room during this period, do request for lower floors like I did. You should have a reasonably quiet & peaceful time.  Highlyâ€¦",Jan-20,,

The room was nice, the location was fantastic, the service except in the Restaurant was fantastic.  The complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour was the best I have had in a long time, well since staying at the Weston in Singapore.  The pool was nice, large and it seemed like you got sun all day long.    I have to say, not one to talk about soap or shampoo, but the amenities in the hotel were fantastic, I actually brought a couple back with me so I could relive the memory.",Jan-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Feb-20,3,Decent hotel,"Stayed in January, Marriott is a decent hotel, however it is overpriced, when i was staying, there was some sort of renovation going on in the hotel. This was not informed to us while we arrived. As it was our first time in Singapore, we went out till late however was waken up slightly before 9am each morning. Great inconvenience, and when mentioned to the reception, there was no follow up to get back to us.  Rates are higher than most hotels in the Orchard area, but the service and product (a little tired, probably due to age of hotel) do not justify the cost.",Jan-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Feb-20,5,Great hotel @ great location,Stayed here before several times and came back after years. Same great location with good connections and underground connections to shopping mall across the street.  Hotel staff  is very kind incl M lounge staff who helped me with printing and scanning some docâ€™s. Food and beverage are good in lounge although not extensive like some other hotels in Singapore. Used an executive suite which was well maintained and of high quality.  Had expected a bit more welcome as accustomed in this part of the world especially given in a Platinum member. Not a big deal but different than other chains.  All with good stay and enjoyed being back.,Feb-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Nov-20,1,Given an untidy room and unhappy reception,Location is great but as excited as we are upon checking-in the reception was unpleasant in treating us. He even gave us un untidy room. We have to go down and show him the pictures of the room (attached below) while waiting for him to finish the other guests. This however wasted our time queuing in again. Just want to feedback this incident because we did not even receive a sincere apology for the mistake on the said incident thus affected our entire stay.,Nov-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Jan-20,4,5-star service but bad facilities,"Went in December 2019 and was really happy with the service as all the staff were very friendly and approachable.

Had to call a few times because even though people came very quickly to fix it, they were unable to fix it completely.",Nov-19,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Oct-20,5,Best staycation hotel experience thus far,"Post circuit breaker, hotels are forced to reinvent and make adjustments to their services which is understandable and have unfortunately impacted stay experience. This is my 4th staycation and this has been the best experience thus far. There was no short changing with a proper ala carte breakfast buffet in Marriott Cafe and 4 hours of happy hour as per pre-covid in the newly renovated M Club (2 hours with hot food which is absolutely delicious.).  Exceptional compliments will go to Mil, Phyllis and the entire club lounge team, I am so sorry I didnâ€™t get the names.  I canâ€™t wait to be back again soon!",Oct-20,,
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,Jan-20,5,Vibrant location but quiet in room,"Admittedly, I was a little disoriented on arrival as the reception desk is tucked away. Check in was fairly pleasant and check out even better. Hats off to the porters for initiative and efficiency. I didn't make use of any restaurants, etc, apart from room service one night, which was fine. It's a swanky place and I assume its location attracts many guests, especially ardent shoppers. Wish I'd stayed here a bit longer. Rooms were almost immaculate.",Jan-20,,

Call the ""at your service"" button, asked to be move to a king bed room. they call back and said no king bed available.  The day after my PA emailed their event team, asked them to move me to a king bed room, they said they will contact me directly for the availability.

The rooms have always been extremely clean, the shower area and bed have always been comfortable. The breakfast buffet spread has always been tasty and satisfying.

The lounge cocktails and canapes are outstanding. The cocktail list immense and the options for a vegetarian like me extensive, excellent foods and drinks and for drinks it's 4 hours long which is fantastic as usually these places only serve for 2.

When we arrived, the bellman was attentive and prompt with our luggage. I did not like that they placed my LV cabin bag on the ground but I continued with walking into the hotel for check-in.   This is really when we went from a 6 to a 10. Miguel was prompt, upgraded our room (Ambassador elite status), explained the entire city and recommended things for us to do.

It was the first time we were with our son after many years and we were looking forward to this family holiday. We arrived late at night tired after a long air flight. We had booked their most expensive club rooms. At check in, the receptionist slipped in a paper into our hands to say (if we read it at all) that there were urgent repairs going on and there may be some noise in the morning. Little did we know that at around 9 AM, a jackhammer sound started on our floor and the noise was ear shattering. The noise went on non-stop for a long time. We had slept less than 5 hours.

And we absolutely loved Rose at reception who made us feel very welcome by holding meaningful conversation with us while we were checked in. I believe this Covid period, some 5-star hotels have become so methodical they forgot guests are human beings who like to have interaction and not just wait in silence for their room access cards.   Anyway thanks to Rose, we booked our slots for the gym and pool and after going to both, proceeded to the club lounge for our dinner and drinks.

Our rainforest shower was working but 1/3 of it doesnâ€™t have water coming out.  Then on our second day, the Aircon broke down and we had to move rooms.

Special mention to Angie, Yani and several staff whose names we unfortunately did not note, for their extreme hospitality and acceding to our requests whenever we had them. Also, one of the housekeeping staff who brought extra pillows and blankets to us upon request, took it upon herself to provide us with more bottles of water seeing that we had 3 people instead of 2.

From the welcome at the curb, to the outstanding welcome and service at the front desk, to the executive club team...the staff at this Westin were tremendous.  The suite was spacious and comfortably appointed.  Large bathroom and shower.  The tub was large enough for me, which is unusual even for suites.  Double closet.  In this particular suite, the closet is away from the bedroom so the dressing area is awkward.  Again, my usual lament against hotel designers not actually sleeping in rooms.

The Westin Singapore,Feb-20,5,Central Location at its best,"Stayed in the Westin Singapore for three nights during our first time in the city.  We have chosen this place due to its location and proximity to all the main attractions.  Stay was pleasant and the team was very efficient. The hotel lobby is located on the 32nd floor and all the rooms are located above it - hence you may get yourself ready to have some nice city views from the high floors.  Swimming pool is quite spacious and not busy at the time we were there - another benefit for those who would like to relax in not a crowded space.

The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,4,Post cruise stopover,"We stayed for one day & night post Asian cruise, the hotel was very accommodating to provide an early check-in and upgrade, probably helped that Iâ€™ve got a reasonable Bonvoy status.  We arrived on a Saturday so the general area around the hotel was fairly quiet as itâ€™s based in the CBD, there are various bars and restaurants in the very close vicinity but most were closed as I presume they support CBD employeeâ€™s during Mon-Fri. It is a very modern new hotel, staff are very accommodating and rooms are lovely. We had some drinks at the bar in the lobby and there is an amazing view out towards the islands and cruise terminal through the huge windows.  There is a short walk through a passageway to the local Singaporean food market which is very popular with tourists and locals, Iâ€¦",Jan-20,,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"We recently stayed at The Westin Singapore during New Year , it was our first time to Singapore and also at The Westin. The hotel was wonderful and nice , service from the staffs (FO and WC) was excellent and amazing. A staff David at the lobby was attentive and approachable to every guests. He helped us by providing  details and tips on the transport  and exact locations.   Happy New Year !  Morgan Kings USA",Dec-19,,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,Great Place to Stay,"We stayed in a large modern room which made up for in space what it lacked in character. Bed was super comfy giving a great night's sleep. We had a club/dining package and the club was the outstanding feature of our stay. Extremely attentive staff and great food and refreshments available during the day. The one disappointment was our single inclusive meal at the unimpressive Cook and Brew. We had been looking forward to this meal and were then handed a ""special"" i.e. greatly restricted menu with only 3 or 4 choices for each course. The staff was very helpful and by forgoing the uninspiring desert  options, I was able to add a some fries to the only main course that I could eat. The conversation stifling piped music did not help and ensured that we did not linger after our meal.",Jan-20,,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,Wonderful Hotel,"We have stayed here three different times over the course of six years. The location is perfect for getting around. Walking distance to the marina. Two minutes from the MRT. The rooms are quiet, beautifully equipped, modern and lovely. Iâ€™m especially taken with the bathroom (lovely soaking tub and large shower). This stay had only one drawback. Since our last stay, another large skyscraper has gone up so the view is blocked to the bay when you have a pool view room.   The gym is perfect, the pool divine, the concierge is exceptionally accommodating.  There is also a yoga studio next door that has great classes at 50% discount for hotel guests.",Jan-20,,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,Lovely stay!,"We stayed here a few nights after our cruise. We got a good deal on luxury escapes. From the moment we arrived it was pleasant. The staff checked us in early and were lovely to deal with. Rooms were spotless and comfortable. We had longe access (Ashley in the lounge was amazing) and ensured our glasses were never empty. We stayed for 3 nights, the first 2 in the lounge ran smoothly and was faultless, however the only criticism I can give is on the third night a manager (I think her name was Tahini) was micromanaging the staff quite obviously and gave off an uncomfortable feeling, so we left. Apart from that the hotel stay was faultless and I would definitely visit again.",Jan-20,,
The Westin Singapore,Feb-20,5,Commendation on outstanding hospitality service,"I visited The Westin Singapore, Seasonal Taste for a lunch. I was brought in by a lady which I was then seated by the window with an amazing sea view. The lady whom served us doesnâ€™t seemed very polite. Subsequently, a manager by the name of Jonathan Tan. He refilled water for us very often as compared to the lady mentioned earlier. Jonathan Tan rendered us an excellent customer service by taking care of us in a very calm and polite manner. He mentioned that he was from the Banquet team. We had quite a few small talks with him and he mentioned that he was helping out in the restaurant on that specific day. And we did asked him whether when will he be at the restaurant again because I would definitely visit this restaurant and be under his care. As observed, he maintained a greatâ€¦",Feb-20,,

The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,"Fabulous 5 star Luxury Hotel, Very Comfortable and Excellent Service","Hotel is located a short walking distance to the Marina bay, a great location to get access to most of the attractions. One of the reasons I choose this hotel.   The hotel starts from level 25 to 46. My room was spacious with a great view and very comfortable. The bathroom was in a contemporary style and spacious too. The hotel provides a good size swimming pool and a fully equipped gym.  The staff was very professional, polite and most helpful.

The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,5,Amazing view!,"We have previously stayed at the Stamford on our previous visits to Singapore but for something different we chose The Westin for our 2 night stopover. Our room was on the 43rd level (Executive Floor) and had a magnificent view across the harbour. The Executive Floor access included a beautiful buffet breakfast, evening drinks and canapÃ©s and is conveniently located adjacent to the infinity pool. Our spacious room was well appointed and the enormous bathroom was very luxurious with the bathtub positioned near a ceiling to floor wall of glass with a view across the harbour also. The hotel is situated in a newer development and is a short walk from the Marina Bay Sands complex and Gardens by the Bay. I really canâ€™t fault this establishment at all. Staff are to be complimented onâ€¦",Dec-19,,
The Westin Singapore,Jan-20,3,"Nice Hotel building and rooms, but sadly lacking in the usual Westin Service Standards!","My visit to the Westin Hotel Singapore didn't start well due to the lack of Service by the Concierge, which is shocking on my arrival and even my departure!  On arrival, the bell hop guy took our luggage out and told us to make our own way up to the front office.  On my departure, I called to book a taxi to get to the airport in advance, only to have to wait another 20mins more when I was ready to leave.    Very unlike the previous Westin Singapore or Westin in other countries I have visited.    Had dinner in the Cook & Brew outlet and the live music was shocking LOUD that I struggled to order my drinks or food OR have a conversation.    Buffet breakfast spread is good but serving staff is also poorly trained.    I know it is the holiday season but standards shouldn't sufferâ€¦",Dec-19,,

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Sep-20,4,Grand old lady,"This hotel is old but upkeep of the hotel was very good. It could do with an updated look. It reminds me of the 80's. Spent 1 night on a weekday at the hotel. Arrived early for checkin. The FD took time to explain the safe management measures in the hotel, such as pre-booking slots for the pool and gym which I did not use. As a platinum member, I was immediately upgraded to a 1BR Suite on the 19th floor facing Scotts Roads. The suite had a separate living and bedroom. The small-ish living room had a small sofa, 2 arm chairs, a very large coffee table and a powder room with WC. The ensuite toilet was very small - 1 sink and the shower was located inside the bath tub. The small bedroom comprised a 4 poster bed and a very small writing desk. Bed was super comfy, aircon powerful.â€¦",Sep-20,,
Sheraton Towers Singapore,Sep-20,5,Wedding Staycation,"Sheraton is experienced and professional in coordinating weddings and solemnisation ceremonies. They have been most accommodating even for a small scale wedding like ours. Simin, our event manager, saw to the coordination and planning of our wedding lunch, and was very attentive to our queries and requests.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Feb-20,1,Very disappointedï¼Personal belongings are lost and the hotelâ€™s reply is perfunctory.,"Our family traveled from Shanghai, China to Singapore on JAN 2020. Considering that Sheraton is an established five-star hotel, we choose it to stay for six days and booked two rooms. We check-in on January 24. Because of the seasonal difference between the two places, we wear autumn shoes and change sandals the next day until we leave (hotel monitoring is available). We check-out at noon on 29th. But at about 18:00 on the 29th when we change shoes at the airport, we found a pair of women's shoes (brand:BALLY SWITHERLAND) left in the room, and immediately informed the hotel. At this point, the check-out time is only a few hours away.In theory, if it wasn't stolen, the shoes must still be in the hotel at this time, but the hotel claimed that they couldn't find it.

The hotel mixed up my pool booking time slots  and there was a delay and confusion while I was trying to order in-room dining. Alvin did a thorough investigation and duly apologized for the pool mistake and explained the delay caused for the in-room dining. It was a communication error. I didnâ€™t expect to hear from anyone from the property when I submitted the survey so I was impressed and this is what I call a good service. Thank you Alvin.

Great suite, high ceiling and a very big dining area. A signs of age can be seen through the overall look and feel of the property. That being said, the level of cleanliness and quality of fittings and furnishings were still top-notch. One of the things I really liked about the room was having all the controls by the bed. The bathroom was not luxuriously big but was decently-sized and with no bath-tub. The Towers Executive Lounge was closed and evening cocktails, canapes and breakfast at dining room instead.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Jan-20,4,A good experience overall!,This was a bit of a transit stop for us ta the tail end of our trip preparatory to departing. We liked our room (1213) as it provided a comfortable space. The best things were the Club Lounge on the third floor and the Pool/Gym area on the 5th floor.

My Platinum elite status was promptly recognised at check in and benefit provided throughout the stay.  Location is very good, walkable to Far East Shopping mall, where you can get pretty good food. But if it rains then it might be an issue as there is no shelter to run to.  Hotel lobby is grand and covid19 precautionary measures are observed. Counter staff is very polite and I love the cashew nuts, welcome gift for elite members.  Our room is amazing, the Amsterdam Suite, special thanks to Alvin for this arrangement.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Feb-20,4,Great 5 star hotel but needs more friendly and polite reception staff,"I have been staying in different Sheraton hotels in different countries but this one gives me a different impression. I still admire the luxurious feel of the hotel and its amenities although the staff or the reception employees are a bit snob and not so much helpful. I will appreciate if they are more approachable and smile sometimes to make the guests a little bit at ease when asking question especially when checking in.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Sep-20,5,Great high tea experience,Itâ€™s impossible to make a last minute booking for high tea nowadays when you have the max group size of 5. My friends and I were frantically trying yesterday to book for today and it was booked out everywhere. So we were really relieved to be able to get a table right by the window in the Dining Room here with the beautiful waterfalls as our backdrop and the whole place practically to ourselves. So glad it was peaceful and quiet when everywhere else wd have been crowded and noisy. Food was good and service excellent.

The food quality is on par (or even better) with other higher category hotels especially the laksa...it's superb.   We met pastry chef, Derrick during breakfast he was so hospitable.

The positives: Great hospitality by /the staff, especially by the team at the Executive Lounge, particularly : Raman, Fely, Laila, Grace, Sufi, Xalien, and Kathleen. A really splendid super team whose non stop. Efforts, greatly enhanced my stay.  The bed was very comfortable, as was the room.   A nice walk up to. Orchard. ( 10 minutes )  The Lobby is dated and not very inviting as a place to relax.  The bathtub requires resurfacing , as it appears aged and dirty. I am certain that housekeeping scrubs it but is is beyond the point of appearing clean and comforatable.   In general, the hotel could use some updating, but the staff is great. I certainly would stay again.",Dec-19,,

He took note of changes and made them seamlessly. Phyo ran the show in the AV room without a hitch. There were many instructions and I initially got my friend to help ensure things proceed well.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,Jan-20,5,Perfect Hotel stay for a quick getaway,"This is a mostly business hotel, which I normally stay for business but I decided to bring my family with for a week on my most recent trip.  Kids are not allowed in the lounge if they are under 12, no problem they will set you up in the lobby bar with the same menu as the lounge which I thought was rather nice, my son loved it!  Apple and Madani took care of us every night during our stay quickly and professionally as you would expect from a Marriot hotel.

The room was spacious and clean even though it's an older hotel. Loved it that we had the bathtub so we could soak our cares away. Thank God we had the tub as time at the pool and gym were limited to one-hour bookings. The pool was sizeable and it was really nice to chill by it with the gardens around us but it was a pity that usage of the gym equipment was restricted due to safe distancing measures. However, Ms Zita and Mr Khairul's friendliness and helpfulness made the booking process and use of the facilities painless. In-house entertainment was varied and the regular fare.

Chef Eric gave us good intro and recommendation.   We started with kueh paitee. A peranakan dish with a twist.  The main platter of rice with lobster was very good. I had the blue pea rice (very fragrant with coconut milk and well seasoned). The accompanied items were fresh and flavorful, especially the chicken and lobster.  The side dishes were free flow, with sambal sotong, sambal greens, oyster omelette, beef rendang, and mutton.   All this went well with either bandung or lychee spritzer and for dessert, the durian tart ended the meal perfectly.  For the price, I really felt it was worth it!",Oct-20,,
Sheraton Towers Singapore,Feb-20,3,Sh*t Happens,"I have stayed at this property before. I like the hotel because it is in the area where I lived for many years in Singapore. There is not much around the hotel as you step outside. However, the Newton MRT station is a short walk away and you can use the two lines to get anywhere in Singapore - even the airport. The famous Newton Circus Food Centre is a short walk away near the MRT station for awesome local food and beer. The walk to Orchard Rd is only about 10-15 mins . The Sheraton hotel itself is a traditional old school grand style Sheraton. Nice but old school. There is nothing wrong with that if this is your taste.

We used to come here for year end family meals in the past, so decided to have a staycation package that included a high tea for 31 Dec and what could have been a nice family tradition was spoilt when the fancy tiered platter turned out to be just a sweets and chocolate tray that was odd for afternoon tea. The wagyu egg ball was too dry and we could not have a refill of  the miniscule savouries in the bottom tier. The 'scones' turned out to be little muffins in texture and taste.

Hotel location allows easy access to food/shopping/entertainment outlets, and yet not situated too close to the crowds in city centre.  Hence offering personal space and relaxation environment unlike the hotels situated within Orchard area, which iare always crowded with people.  More importantly, the services from check in counters, restaurant, lounge and housekeeping are simply excellent.

Service and food was amazing , Family and friends had such a ball of a time ! We chose the smaller topaz ballroom which proved a right choice as the atmosphere was warm and cosy. Special mention to Blesie and Chao Xian for the flawless  running of the operation. Blesie was prompt in emails and communication and open to changes and Chao Xian was on top of everything on the banquet day .They both made what seemed like a challenging few months of wedding prep and anxiety seem all worth it in the end .

First of all, the customer service from the waiters and waitresses to the managers were all incredibly well mannered and were very attentive despite it being decently crowded for COVID standards.  The food there was phenomenal. As it was a "" refillable small plate"" concept, my family and I got to try many different dishes. The nasi lemak's sambal was sweet and spicy but not too spicy. It was really good and everyone knows that sambal is the star of nasi lemak!  As I am someone who loves meat, I enjoyed the chicken cutlet, black beef and lamb. I found all of them to be super tender (so good job to the chef!) but out of them all, I loved the lamb.  My family and I would definitely come back here again.â€¦",Oct-20,,

However, I have never stayca and/or properly dine in this Hotel before especially when this property is within my era.  I was introduced to The Dining Room because they have one Classic and another similar food item that I have been looking for. I learnt about these 2 items in my early 90s and into year 2000 and, could not easily find them in Singapore.   From their Executive Lunch Set Menu, I found my favourite ... ... Classic Chicken Cordon Bleu. The chicken is fried beautifully, golden and crispy. Is layered with cheese and ham and then rolled, perfectly swirled on the inside.

There were hand sanitizer everywhere and food individually served. The server for my area named Yang Kai was amazingly attentive. My wine never reached the bottom of my glass and all I requested was prompted served. I just need to look up and the extra side plate I was thinking came running to my table.

Booked a rate with breakfast and found the food to be generous in portion and overall quite tasty, although I still miss the pre-covid buffet.

It came with a winter wonderland type drink, 6 (LARGE) oysters, a seafood platter full of shellfish, crab and prawns, salmon and tuna sashimi platter and refillable entrÃ©es. The refillable dishes consisted of a prawn pumpkin bisque and mushroom soup, turkey, steak (cooked to a perfect medium rare!) and fish among other things.

We also opted for the $50 food and beverage credit which was a good way to order in room dining. PS/ The Wagyu burger was great.  In my opinion the Sheraton was a nice stay, it was within walking distance to Newton MRT and if you feel like a good walk, Orchard is a bout 10 minutes away on foot.

But the fact that we need to be physically present there to book a time slot for swimming is just not very convenient (i thought we can just book by calling them). When we tried to book a time slot for swimming, they told us that we can only have 1 booking during our stay. I find this a bit weird because if we stay for 1 week...it means we can only use the swimming pool once? Eventually we found out that this is a misunderstanding after the staff clarified with the hotel manager. We were also surprised that we can only order 1 ala carte menu per person during breakfast.

I had hoped the hotel had other means of contacting them, like sending an email. I even put up my questions on their social media sites, but without success. Eventually, I resorted to calling the hotel to get an answer. With the app, I also found the chatbot very useful and the responses prompt.

The lobby is the opposite of warmâ€”a dark and cold cavernous space, with a couple of cheap-looking couches places to the side as an after thought.  No greetings, no friendly smiles  as you approach the front desk.          The worst example of poor customer service is Tammy, the  breakfast greeter.

No separate shower area.   In room dining was good but funnily my kids ordered an item twice over our stay and it was presented completely differently both times.

We were unexpected guests as our holiday plans had been altered last minute due to the Covid-19 virus, but the staff there were able to accommodate us and make us feel very welcome. Jermin from the front desk found out it was our anniversary and she helped make our stay particularly special with a lovely handwritten note and thoughtful gift, and was always available to answer our questions and organise activities.

The led-up to the wedding was fraught with many uncertainties - whether we could or should even continue with the event, and if we did go ahead, what precautionary measures to take to ensure the safety of our guests and the hotel staff.  Manju was our wedding coordinator, and she assisted us unreservedly with the precautionary measures we requested; she and her team also came up with recommendations to put all our minds at ease.

The Outpost Hotel Sentosa by Far East Hospitality,Apr-20,4,Great way to spend our 1st Year anniversary,"It was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, it was more due to the amazing staff (Amit, Sashi and Caicyn in particular), ambience, service, the pool and the fittings in the room were well thought of! The view is great 7/10 for a beach view as you still see the monorail depot in front of the hotel, and the ships in the Straits of Malacca. Key highlights were the bed+bathroom, hotel pool, roof top pool and the staff.

Expedia showed it as adults only but it is not. This hotel shares services with another hotel called the Village which is familt and children oriented. The pool facilities are shared, dining facilities are shared, gym facilities are shared. Not adults Only. The rooms are nice but small, you can not leave your luggae open or you will have no place to walk. It is OK but not worth the money paid, I was only there 3 days any longer and I would have moved to another hotel. I can not recommend this hotel",Nov-19,,

The swimming pool view that I requested for at an early stage was SERIOUSLY RESTRICTED. I paid extra cash for that. On top of that, Atikah, at the check in counter claimed that my card wasnt able to use. So I had to call my sister to come and pass her card instead. On top of that, Atikah asked for my parents' IDS who were there to come and just visit us for my sisters' birthday celebration.

She is very warmhearted and friendly to me and my father.She offered us a free upgrade room service from the normal room to a sea-view room and also gave us a small gift, which is so thoughtful and considerable. Because we were new here and not familiar with the geography of the scenic spots in this island, she told us a lot of interesting places. And because of her fluent Chinese, my father also got a good understanding of the recreational facilities of Sentosa. This great living experience left me a good impression of Singapore.

I paid $350/night for room 601. Upon arrival staff was provided little service. I had to get my suitcase from the lobby.   The restaurant closes to early and the bar menu is gross.   There was nothing special about the hotel. If I paid a third of what I paid, I would never feel so cheated by a hotel.

Goodwood Park Hotel,Sep-20,3,Good location but lack of info before booking,"Was here for a staycation and was going to use the pool and chill. Had a good deal on the Parklane suites, but it was really far away from the main building. Had I known about the Hotel layout, and the Mayfair rooms and pool, I would have made other bookings.  The Parklane suites are far away and because it was raining all weekend we had to walk in the rain via a back route that was really sketchy.  We were told that a buggy could be asked to come get us to and from the building but it would have taken too long to call etc.  The room is old and smells lived in, but it was clean and the kitchen appliances seemed new and easy to use. The washer/dryer had complementary bags of detergent. We joked that it felt like an air bnb overseas, so we could see how this would be a good deal for longer term stays.  We had dinner at Gordonâ€™s Grill and it was a lovely meal with very reasonably priced cuts of steaks that they came table side to cut for us. But the highlight was the table side crepe Suzette and the vanilla ice cream!  We were able to capitalize on the location and went for a quick shopping trip to the malls around even though it was raining, it was easy to get around. Hotel room didnâ€™t have umbrellas but we had brought our own.  On the day of check out, the lobby smelt like paint and we were able to get a later check out time so it was great.  On hindsight, Iâ€™d have booked the Mayfair rooms for the smaller pool access and they gyms are located there too.  So Iâ€™ve included the map of the hotel grounds for insight for other travels.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,"Location, location, location!","Due to our cruise cancellation our three night stay here turned into twelve nights. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Swissotel on Stamford. Despite previous posts, we found the check in process to be simple, we were helped by a staff member and our bags were taken up to our room by another very friendly man. Our room was on the 38th floor, it was spacious and very comfortable, although the beds seemed smaller than double beds. Our view over the city was breathtaking. The pool area was pleasant and there were never any issues finding a sun lounge. The best thing about this hotel is the location, so many attractions are a short walking distance away. There are two MRT stations very close and there is a large shopping mall underneath. The only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars, is because we had a daily issue with housekeeping. There were three people staying in our room yet each day they only left enough towels for two people. The other issue we had was breakfast, thankfully we didn't pay for breakfast every day, but on the few times we did have it we found it to be extremely crowded. We had to walk over to the Fairmont each morning for breakfast and we always had to wait in line to get in the restaurant. There was also a long wait for a lot of the food, particularly the egg station. It was not a pleasant experience. Despite these two negatives, we couldn't imagine staying anywhere else if we return to Singapore.â€¦",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,Lovely view and spacious comfortable room,"I love the view, beautiful sea and city (MBS & Flyer view) and it looks mesmerizing at night. Room is spacious for a Premier room. Thereâ€™s a sofa with work desk and swivel chair that can seat 3 people comfortably. The toilet is spacious although the flush for the WC didnâ€™t work. It was quickly rectified by technician at night when I was back in my room. I enjoyed the Nespresso and TWG tea provided in room and during the day when I was out, house keeping staff came in and topped up the coffee capsules and left some Toblerone chocolates by the bed. The room furniture and bathroom fittings look and feel new. Bed feels clean although pillow is too soft for me. I did not check if a pillow menu was available before turning in. One thing that I thought could be improved was the print out slip that indicated my room number and other hotel information. It was printed on a credit.  card charge slip; it feels cheap, flimsy and unbefitting for the luxury hotel. I understand it is cheaper to print it out as such but perhaps printing it out on a thicker piece of paper wonâ€™t increase costs by that much.  Iâ€™m a normal Accor member and did not receive any room upgrade or access to Executive Lounge nor  complimentary breakfast. It is chargeable for about s$100 plus but I did not opt for that as I have my child with me, and my child will not be able to enter the Executive Lounge during cocktail hour. Overall I enjoyed the room a lot and the comfortable and new fittings in the room made my stay really homely. A great experience overall! Thanks Swissotel. â€¦",Mar-20,,

Misses:  1) TV wasnâ€™t working when we entered the room. Technician had to restart the TV and change our remote.  2) Even after restarting the TV, channels were slow to load ie even after staying at the channel for 5 mins the TV was still showing a black screen even though we could hear the show. Called in the operator line and was told it take time to load. Unfortunately it took too long (or in some cases, never). Ended up watching HBO throughout the stay because thatâ€™s the only channel whereby image was loaded in addition to audio.  3) Felt stuffy when we first entered the room and adjusted the air con to the lowest temperature and highest fan speed.

Also feel very peaceful, itâ€™s suitable for nature & history lovers. Friendly staff, simple unique room decor (as the bathroom in the balcony) but I just love it! Especially with the wooden floor...really make me feel, step back in kampung time!",Mar-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,5,A Magical Oasis,"This was my third stay at Hotel Fort Canning, I must repeat comments I made on my previous posts regarding this hotel. It really is a beautiful hotel in the most stunning gardens, it's tranquillity amongst the busy Singapore City makes this place so unique. Two beautiful swimming pools and relaxing area's to sit in out out of the sun, great breakfast and excellent staff. Special mention to Abigail, thanks for all of your help finding and booking for us great restaurants and making our stay so enjoyable. I will be back with my family later this year",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Mar-20,4,Good central location with very welcoming staff,"Good location if you are fit enough to handle the steps/slopes to walk back through the lovely park back from the the city and/or are happy to use taxis. Really good swimming pool areas. Breakfast was very good. Garden room not really worth the extra cost since, given the humidity, we didn't use the facility much.  Complimentary drinks and canapes  between 6pm and 7pm  a nice touch. Hotel staff very helpful and welcoming.",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,4,A quiet sophisticated stay in a historic building,"I loved the ""welcome back"" I received from the front desk and the fact that they were able to check us in early with no bother.  The pool area is lovely though the sun beds/round pool loungers could do with some padding/mattresses.  The hotel was extremely quiet for the festive period which I guess is why they tried to shut the bar at 10:45pm one night!  Seems a bit early for a 5 star hotel.  My only other grumble was again related to the bar - there seemed to be a very young and inexperienced chap serving who just didn't seem ready to be (mainly) left on his own to serve drinks.  Poor kid looked petrified at times.  Other than that, it is my favourite hotel in Singapore, just a few steps away from the Battle Box tour (of an Underground Bunker used by the Allies during theâ€¦",Dec-19,,

Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,"Great hotel, location and service!","We enjoyed the location and convenience of Hotel Fort Canning because it's in town and there are a lot of things to do. But at the same time, the lush greenery and quietness surrounding the hotel (it's on Fort Canning Hill) makes for a calming respite.   Service was excellent and I just want to call out Kelson Yeo for his welcoming and great attitude too!",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,5,Beautiful and majestic hotel,My husband and I stayed here for two nights during our short visit to Singapore this January. We absolutely loved the location of this hotel as it was on top of Fort Canning Park. We felt so peaceful and secluded from the busy streets of Singapore.   The hotel rooms are lovely and have high ceilings. I used the gym once and they had a good range of equipment. Since the hotel is in a park you could definitely go outside for a run.  I would highly recommend this hotel!,Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,"Good hotel, an enjoyable experience","Had such a warm welcome upon arrival by Kelson, the front office manager. Everything was went through thoroughly. There was a small rebate given upon check-in since we booked directly from the hotel's website. Thank you to Julian too for showing us the room. Love the service and room amenities.

Convenient central location. Quays easily walkable.  Lovely pools, lovely breakfasts, lovely Happy Hours.  Good in-house dining arrangements that are sensibly priced.  Most importantly every member of staff, without exception, was courteous and attentive. They are all relaxed, approachable and so very professional.  As memorable and relaxing a hotel experience as you could possibly wish for.   If ever in Singapore again, this is where we will stay.   Meanwhile we unreservedlyâ€¦",Feb-20,,

Booked a Deluxe room for 1 night and upgraded to Deluxe Garden another night. Total stay was 3 days 2 nights. Both rooms were beautiful! Brought some friends over the second day to chill before the concert however, the staff informed that they could only stay up till 930pm which was totally fine with us. Overall, we were pleased with they stay! Would definitely come back again especially if there are concerts that are playing at FC!",Feb-20,,

Hotel Fort Canning,Apr-20,5,certainly an oasis in Singapore,"We happened to be there just as COVID-19 was ramping, and really enjoyed our stay there.  The happy hour was great to mingle with other travellers and exchange stories, the balcony converted into a bathroom was fun, the proximity to places of interest was good, and overall the experience was great.  Will definitely visit again.",Mar-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,5,Beautifully restored heritage hotel with great hospitality,"Hotel Fort Canning is a pleasant surprise in the urban jungle of Singapore.  Despite being conveniently located in the central of Singapore, itâ€™s nestled within lush greenery and away from then city hustle.  The colonial hotel exterior is grandiose, yet the facilities of the hotel room is very updated and technologically advanced.  The beautiful fusion of history and modern comfort makes the stay with Hotel Fort Canning a memorable one.  Was especially impressed with the white marbled bathroom boasting the garden view.  The design of the hotel room also allows abundant sunlight and great view of the surrounding foliage.  The hotel staffs also display exemplary hospitality, from the check-in counter staffs that lead me all the way to my room after checking-in and orientating meâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,Classic Colonial Hotel,This hotel is a perfect example of the reuse of a classic colonial style building. The location is excellent within the park and easy walking distance to the city. Rooms are large and well presented with all features of the rooms very useable. Good size pool. Restaurant is good and buffet breakfast excellent. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. May not be the cheapest in town but definitely worth it. Would definitely stay again if stopping over in Singapore.,Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Mar-20,4,Loved the complimentary wine and aperitifs every afternoon,A truly unique hotel stay in Singapore amongst the greenery of Fort Canning Park. The hotel is atmospheric and beautifully appointed.  Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station for easy access to everything in Singapore. Staff were only too happy to accommodate our every need and assisted with lots of useful sightseeing advice! The restaurant was delicious and inexpensive. The swimming pools were perfect and complimentary towels appreciated. Our only recommendation would be that the raised tile edge around the bath in the room is a trip / toe stubbing hazard for travellers in unfamiliar rooms during night time bathroom visits. ( We had a garden view room).,Mar-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,1,Not the best choice for Singapore,"I know this City well and had lived here for 10 years, came back to visit. Picked this hotel due to its colonial appeal. Quite misleading, tiny claustrophobic rooms, very inconvenient to go back and forth from, barely any actual colonial ambience. Room cleanliness mediocre. I would definitely not recommend this hotel given the plenty of choices Singapore has to offer that are much better, more convenient and come at a much more attractive price. I give it a poor rating.",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,Awesome experience,"We did our wedding here at HFC and also stayed here for a few nights. The experience was way beyond our expectations. The hotel is beautiful, styled in old colonial style, complete with all the most modern facilities. Staff are one of the most amazing team of people Iâ€™ve ever met! From the front reception to the concierge, from the banquet staff to the restaurant/bar team - everyone fully demonstrated service with a smile - making our stay the most pleasant ever. The complimentary drinks (sparkling, red and white wines + juices) n canapÃ©s served daily at the nice reception area for all guests was definitely a delight. We werenâ€™t the only ones who were blown away. In total we had 7 rooms of friends and relatives who stayed here too and all of them were full of praises for HFC.â€¦",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Mar-20,5,View from the Hill,"The hotel is in a graceful old (but well refurbished) building at the top of a hill top park near the CBD. I had a very comfortable room with a patio - although note that curtains need to be deployed to have privacy from anyone walking past, Easy walking distance to several excellent museums through a lovely park (dont miss the Apothecary's Garden). After a long humid day exploring Singapore it was lovely to come back to the hotel for a swim and to relax in comfortable surrounds. Staff always at the ready to assist.",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Apr-20,5,Beautiful hotel and service,"Such an oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  The old colonnial style of the hotel is reflected in the calming and restful environment in the hotel.  Our room was beautiful - plenty of room with a separate large bathroom area with bathtub and large shower.   The electric roman blinds were a great touch.  The staff could not do enough for us, being very professional yet friendly and approachable.  I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and book again at the drop of a hat.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",Mar-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,top class service,"We stayed for two nights and in a standard room. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms luxurious - high ceilings and marble everything in the bathroom.  The high ceilings made the room feel a lot more spacious and our large windows looked towards Canning Park.  We were advised on checkin that there was a wedding the following night but we didn't hear a thing so the noise did not disturb us.  It is lovely to walk around the park in the early morning and it is very close to the MRT, Clarke Quay and the Singapura Mall.  But the standout for me was the service on the front desk.  They diligently but respectfully took our temperatures on checkin and when we asked them to daily (due to the corona virus precautions).  They helped with grab taxis and information but I wasâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,4,Quality hotel at a great price,An old style hotel brought up to date in a quiet location in the park but actually only a short walk downhill to canal and places to eat and shop.  We chose this place because we donâ€™t like the huge corporate type soulless hotels and because it is in a quieter location. It came at a competitive price compared with the corporate hotels so perfect. The room was excellent with everything we could need and a comfortable sleep. Breakfast gave a good choice of Western and Eastern choices.  Two pools which were always quiet. A pity the sun-beds donâ€™t have mattresses There is a restaurant for evening meals with the typical mix of meals.  A nice touch was the free guest drink between 6 and 7.   Perhaps a member of staff could circulate and give guests an opportunity to ask questionsâ€¦,Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,5,Wonderful stay in a characterful colonial hotel,"Stayed at Hotel Fort Canning on a recommendation from two friends who had stayed and we were delighted we did. Wonderful colonial building set in historic Fort Canning. Great location 10 min walk from Orchard Road and the MTR and 15 minutes walk through the park to Clarke Quay on the river. Very much a garden oasis in the middle of Singapore. I exercised regularly in the Park as well as the in house gym (lots of great kit).  We arrived about 2pm and checked in without a wait. Really nice room - feature is the bathroom at the window end of the room. Good lighting and storage. The two swimming pools are wonderful and manage a garden feel.   Service was excellent.   This is not a big chain hotel so less staff and the team multi tasks. Reception doubles as the concierge, as well asâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,5,"Excellent service, food and accommodation.","The hotel is set in a small park in the centre of Singapore. The building has a colonial history as has the surrounding area. Positioned on a hill the park has covered escalators to acess the nearest metro station. The bedroom was a good size, with a large comfortable bed, as was the bathroom which had a bath and seperate shower.  Public rooms are of a reasonable size, well decorated and comfortably furnished. Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast, lunch and dinner menus were good, with local dishes, but fairly limited.  Complimentary drinks and nibbles between 6 and 7 were appreciated by most guests, plus an extended Happy Hour in the bar and restaurnt.",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Feb-20,4,Wonderful staycation,"We usually do walks and exercises at the Fort Canning park and everytime we pass by the hotel we always like the vibe hence we plan to stay one day. Now that we are in, the impression we had is the same or even better.  The location is within the city center, accessible by a few walks from both Fort Canning and Dhoby Gaut MRT stations. Despite the city location this hotel is tucked within the greens of the park giving you that peaceful and relaxing feel.  Check in was a breeze, i like the sit down-table kind of style, very personalized. Julian was attentive and thorough, he also took time to walk me through the amenities of the room, very good customer service.   The room is well divided, it has modern amenities with classic interiors. I really love the bathroom, very spaciousâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Jan-20,5,the service at this hotel is excellent.,"We have organized multiple events through this hotel involving both conference packages and organization of hotel rooms for visitors (including around 20-30 reservations placed over the last few years). We have also personally stayed in the hotel on several occasions both for holidays and work reasons.   The rooms and facilities are very pleasant, however  the main reason we continue coming back to this location is the staff. The hotel staff are always very thoughtful, I always get the impression that they have carefully considered my request and done their best to acomodate it (even if sometimes the answer is no, in general it is clear they have clearly thought very hard about how/whether they could make it possible). Overall this makes the hotel a very relaxed place to dealâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Hotel Fort Canning,Mar-20,4,Lovely colonial hotel.,"The hotel is set within Fort Canning Park within 5 - 10 mins walk of 2 MRT stations.  Initial impressions were good although our greeting at reception was a bit brusque.  I fully appreciate that the hotel was concerned about coronavirus, as were we, but the first words out of the man at reception was â€œI need to take your temperatureâ€.  A hello and welcome would have been nice first as we had been travelling for over 20 hours.  It was good that they also did this daily at breakfast and also before I could use the gym.  Our room was lovely but, as others have said, you are unable to use the bathroom without putting the electric blinds down first.  The design of the shower meant that water leaked onto the bathroom floor. This is because the door sits on a raised piece of marble soâ€¦",Feb-20,,

I was so afraid I might end up queuing for hours as most hotels encountered the previous weekend but this was simply amazing. I literally walked in and walked straight to my room (considering there were no prior arrangements for staggered check-in etc). The lady with the Japanese name was simply amazing, she would have roomed me I believe, but she just walked me to the lift (and ensured I've got my parking coupon beforehand). And that time I knew already this staycation was gonna be fantastic.   Got a marina bay room and I could just sit there watching the view (and the pool, which unfortunately I couldn't get a slot for the both days, didn't occur I should check reviews here first to book earlier).

Both room has gorgeous view of the Singapore Flyer, MBS, and CBD - absolutely amazing at night too! Everything was very clean, well-stocked with refreshments, and also super spacious.

We had booked our pool slots few weeks prior to our stayca to avoid disappointment, so had no issues getting our slots.

MO went all out to ensure that the concerns my wife and I had were addressed, and made sure we were not short-changed at our end. They followed the Safe-Management Measures (SMM) set by the govt very closely, and helped alley the fears of our banquet guests. On the wedding banquet lunch day on 22 Nov, Alice went out of her way to help my wife (the bride), my mother and my mother-in-law in small little details. She even helped cut the food for my grandma!

Check in was seamless on 19th Nov, and when I entered the room, guest relations had not only remembered we were celebrating a birthday,  but had done decorated the room for a birthday and had delivered a wonderfully delicious chocolate birthday cake.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Feb-20,2,"Great Staff, But Everything Else Gets a Thumbs Down.",".  On a month long trip around Asia we had expected the Mandarin Oriental Singapore to be really fabulous, it is after all billed as a Luxury 5* hotel. It was certainly the most expensive. Yet it was the biggest disappointment. And despite paying for the Oriental Club Level and one of the larger scenic marina views, it was the smallest room weâ€™ve ended up with in a hotel in years, with a midget sized bath.   The layout of the hotel itself is also unappealing, like a car park with a vast central atrium where you look upwards to see every floor, almost prison like. And unlike some other MO hotels, this one had no grand lobby or seating area. In truth, they are more interested in hiring out parts of the lobby for conferences and weddings, which you can easily mistakenly walk into.â€¦",Jan-20,,

The room, as you would expect in a 5 star hotel, was very well serviced and immaculate.  Initially we were a little nervous about visiting Singapore with the ongoing Covid 19 outbreak which seemed to have hit Singapore quite badly initially.  Our nervousness was misplaced, the country seems to have a grip on it and the hotel had in place heat monitors so nobody entered the premises without being checked on their way in.    The concern over the virus has undoubtedly impacted on the hotel and occupancy rates are very low, this was a double edged sword as it meant the public spaces were missing the vibe you might have expected, the up side is that the pool area was neverâ€¦",Mar-20,,

The bathroom is dated with a very small tub. As for the toilet cabinet, it is big but completely empty and covered with plaster on the walls. Another thing that I disliked, the lightings, It is not possible to turn off some lamps. In the living room, there is only one master button to turn everything on or off.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Jan-20,3,Underwhelming at almost every level,"Full disclosure: this was my first stay at a Mandarin Oriental property, so perhaps my expectations werenâ€™t realistic. I assumed it would be on par with a St. Regis, Four Seasons, Ritz Carleton or Peninsula hotel in Asia. It definitely wasnâ€™t in essentially any dimension. Hereâ€™s why:  Rooms:  I booked a suite for my family. It was spacious but extremely tired. It has probably been 20+ years since it was remodeled and it looked that way, especially in the bathrooms. I would put it on par with an older Sheraton or Westin property. The beds were also not particularly comfortable.  We had booked the reservation for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids). They brought in one rollaway bed. I had assumed they would make up the big couch for my other kid to sleep on. Both nights, they left someâ€¦",Jan-20,,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Wonderful- will definitely be back!,"My husband and I brought our toddler for a staycation at Mandarin Oriental and we just checked out a couple of hours ago. Will we be back? YES!  After reading the horror check in stories for other hotels over the weekend, we were rather afraid as I donâ€™t think we can wait even more than an hour with a fussy toddler. To our surprise, we could check in EARLY. Without waiting more than 10 minutes. Already a wonderful start!   We booked the Ocean Grand Room and it was very clean. View was good and my toddler loved looking at the vehicles zooming past. It was beautiful at night as well. Only problem we had with the room was that the shower wasnâ€™t working- only extremely hot water came out. We werenâ€™t comfortable with people coming in to fix due to the current pandemic situation so weâ€¦",Dec-20,,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Oct-20,5,Their Service Tops it All,"Stayed at Mandarin Oriental over the weekend. It has been quite a long time I have not stepped foot on this hotel. The hotel is still miraculously able to hide all the signs of aging at the age of 30+, as it opened the door in 1987. The hotel's last renovation probably was done a decade ago and I can vividly remember the hotel was closed entirely for a good 3 months. It was a transformation.   The hotel was designed by the renowned architect John Portman, known for his Atrium lobby. After so many years, I still irresistibly look up the spiral view of the atrium in awe.   The room of this luxury brand is not the largest compared to other 5 star hotels within the vicinity nor the in-room design is the swankiest amongst their rivals, not to name them to protect their interests.â€¦",Oct-20,,

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Jan-20,3,Great views from high end rooms but let down by poor service,"Our first impression was that the Lobby is too dark and a bit cramped with no place to sit. People were milling everywhere and it gave the impression of chaos. Check In was quick but not particularly friendly. No explanation was given about why we were charged more than our confirmed rate, nor was any explanation given about breakfast or the hotel facilities. We were given our keys and told where the lifts were and that was it. We were tired so we went to our room and then realised they overcharged us. So, we went downstairs and spoke to a different person, who explained the extra amount was for an extra night that would be refunded. She also answered our questions about shopping malls near by and the best way to go to marina bay sands, even going so far as to walk us outsideâ€¦",Dec-19,,

Expensive poolside menu (1 bottled beer S$22)  Melt cafe is amazing. Check in process is very slow.

The hour long firework show on NYE with 500 drones from Star Island was off the scale.  We loved the MO Bar with its fabulous vibe & inventive cocktails, the pool area with cabanas, food & service was fantastic & the buffet breakfast was great although we thought Rise at MBS was better. We took advantage of the free 10min scooter & sidecar ride with Simon which was fun & interesting & very different to anything we'd experienced before.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Feb-20,4,Mostly great,"We were here for the weekend and, as one would expect, the hotel felt more suited to business travellers than a family holiday. Service was very good and efficient, but sometimes lacked warmth.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best Iâ€™ve ever seen - vast choice and exceptional quality.  The pool is great, complete with day beds and a view over the bay. Although the life guards were quite authoritative about what not to do - eg my toddler son and I were playing with his croc sandal in the water, floating it like a boat, which was not allowed.  Nice rooms with very comfortable beds, even if the room felt small with a slightly dated bathroom.  The Mandarin Oriental in some ways seemed very committed to sustainability and their environmental practices, for example by providingâ€¦",Feb-20,,

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Nov-20,5,Refreshing getaway with a wonderful view,"The 3D2N staycation @ Mandarin Oriental was fantastic due to its location, friendly staff and most of all, the view. I had the Marina Bay view and it overlooked MBS all the way with a panorama view till Fullerton.  What i did not like: - Cot provided was way too low to put my child (4 months) into. When asked for a rollaway bed, it was not available. - Carpark was most troublesome as it was not within the hotel and worst, there is no lift, which is most inconvenient for those with prams. However, one of the staff there happened to cross path and insisted on helping us carry all the way down. Kudos to him!   Despite the above, it was still a very wonderful stay and would definitely be back!",Nov-20,,

I want to rate staff Princes 200/100.   The food, the pool, the bar is SUPERB!!  The hotel is already perfect but what makes it stand out to other hotel Iâ€™ve visited before was their staff. I donâ€™t know how you selected good staff but itâ€™s really good for your business. My friends saw my posts and review on social medias and theyâ€™re really excited to visit and try MOSIN.

From the minute I arrived I was made to feel like a VIP by every member of the MO team.  Luxurious room with a bed so comfortable I was reluctant to get up each morning.  Great breakfast options each day although I did feel that the staff were very over stretched at times.

TOP TIP - join the MO member program (for free) and get freebies to make your stay better.    One of my favorite places to stay in the world, and not pretty reasonably priced for what you get.",Feb-20,,

This was my first stay at MO, after experiencing the other nearby brands previously. I will say I expected more. MO us more expensive then some of the other nearby hotels, so obviously I expect a little more. In the end , my conclusion is that only the marina bay view is worth the money. If you are staying in the city view, itâ€™s not worth it. The room itself , though aged, but itâ€™s ok. The service itself is cold at best. The concierge is quite horrible. The elderly gentleman in red costume is fine, those in suit looks more like secret agent, and never ever open the door in the multiple times I walk through that same main entrance.

One hiccup was access to the pool. We didn't realise booking for pool access could be done b4 check-in and found out upon check in that all slots were reserved throughout our two night stay :( Would have been good if it was highlighted at point of booking we should do our booking b4 checking or just allocate slots to all guests anyway?",Dec-20,,

Next to it, is the Dolce Vita restaurant, an aunthentic Italian cuisine where we had our sumptuous dinner on our first night.   The breakfast selections are well presented and delightful.

In the club lounge : Louis, Elle, Xui Fang, Rio). The food at breakfast and in the lounge was delicious.  Why I gave 4.5 and not 5 : The corridors are dated (new carpet and wallpaper are needed).  We complained about a flickering light and the toilet (the water did not stop running after we flushed)  but it never got sorted out.

Overall it was good but some minor improvements would have made it even better. Requested for firm pillows but i think they did not have sufficient to go around and hence didnt have a good rest. During breakfast (which i think they could be running a little tight on manpower during peak hours), my boy's porridge didnt come with you tiao and my nasi lemak didnt come with achar. We didnt even realised our meals were short of items until we saw the table next to us. Breakfast had less variety due to COVID.

The Pool bar serves food and drinks AND also allows people to smoke which is appalling. Non smokers are confined to a few meagre tables under the eaves of a nearby building . Nowhere else in the world would this happen in a 5 star hotel! Non smokers are given minority status where smokers are allowed a free hand.  As a world wide traveller I Have never experienced anything like this before and would never visit Singapore again without checking this issue of smokers dominating public eating areas!,Feb-20,,

They literally service you from the moment you reach their doorstep. We had a training-duty-manager, Bobby, that checked us in. He was polite, cheerful and insightful where he guides you through the whole process from documentation, recommendations and directions. Moreover, we casually asked about wedding setups and he immediately pulled out MO and his own contacts for us, walking us through MO's offerings. In short, I remember MO because of Bobby's service excellence. Not to undermine the rest, because every staff was impeccable in their attitude and gracious in sharing their enthusiasm.",Sep-20,,

The hotel is located at a very strategic position, for almost all fireworks that happen around the Marina Bay Area, as there are other rooms facing the different positions.   One of the items that I hope the hotel can improve on, will be the internet connection. During this stay, that does not seems to wow as an end user. Other than that, the rest are great !

Covid or not, the service by the front desk was flawless.  The room was clean and our room had a great view of the flyer and MBS.  I loved that pool time is strictly kept to 2 hours and you had to book ahead. This mean no overcrowding and we managed to snag a pod to laze by the afternoon sun.

Service was consistently good throughout the stay with the highlight coming from the MO bar staff and the front desk officer who took a picture of the family and used that to customise a birthday card for the occasion hand written and signed of by the team.

Deeply moved by the front desk agent who conveyed comforting words after realizing that this staycation was planned to ease my work stress. It was really warmed.    Back to the stay, our room was upgraded from Ocean View to Marina Bay View, and we were offered welcome drink after joining as a member of the hotel group. The cocktail @ MO Bar was excellent. Our package also include a dinner set at Melt Cafe. Appetizer: Bread with pumpkin soup was excellent.

When we arrived, she took care of our every single need and made an effort to know my kidsâ€™ names. She was knowledgeable about every aspect of the hotel including the recommended dishes and drinks of different restaurants and bars. No detail was too small for her. Other staff which exemplified the M.O level of service included Alex, Giruba and Mr Stalin at the poolside. They were all welcoming and made sure the rain didnâ€™t spoil our fun at the pool.   Just one small feedback. The gym hark back to the 80s. With the emphasis on fitness now, the gym could do with much more space and modern equipment. We also felt that the breakfast service was a bit underwhelming.â€¦",Sep-20,,

We were warmly greeted at the reception and brought to the room by the staff who makes a real effort to explain soooo many things (thanks to covid). Also there in the room was a Birthday cake for the hubs. :) The pool was lovely and not very crowded. We had 2hrs slot per room and we felt that we didn't have to rush. We even had a mini snack @ the pool side before it started to pour. Dinner was at Melt and the staff attending to our table (Hutckson & Tim) were really nice and attentive.

The rooms were clean and spacious (I enjoyed a free upgrade to the Marina Bay view Deluxe King Room via the Klook deal).   2. Very personalized customer service, it was my birthday celebration and they prepared balloons and cakes with personalized messages (handwritten) -  very endearing.   3. Check in/out was seamless and fast. Food at the hotel was great, with huge portions and great variety.   4. Free parking and every one I met was polite and welcoming.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Feb-20,5,Wedding and hotel stay,"The MO team - led by Elena, Jasmine, Jegan for our wedding banquet - made our entire wedding planning process smooth and stress-free. The team from the Chef, to the AV manager, to the coupleâ€™s butler showed so much dedication and pride in doing their jobs well. They were unfailingly attentive to our needs and to details large and small, and were an absolute joy to work with. We couldnâ€™t have asked for more in a team.

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Sep-20,5,Awesome Staycation with the Famiy!,"In summary, there are no words to decribe this experience. I like doing staycations to experience hotels standards, services, facilities and I must say, Mandarion Oriental (MO) tops it. Albeit, the hotel is not a new one but the interiors are well maintained and furnished. The food quality is great as well although it will be good to have more variety of food for the breakfast buffet or perhaps a different menu on alternate days. This would give the hotel stayers more choices to try out the MO-quality food.  BUT what impresses my wife and I is the service level of the staff and the management team. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay over 2 nights, interacting and engaging the staffs with smiling faces throughout.  Below are some examples which I like to highlight and commend the MOâ€¦",Sep-20,,

The room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and seaview. Happy with the bath tub and well appointed bathroom. The staff was friendly from the front desk, Melt Cafe, MO Bar, Cherry Garden and to the concierge/door man staff. Housekeeping was also efficient in getting items requested. Special mention to Andrews (I think) for checking the bill and making things right, Sun for lugging my luggage down the staircase to the car park, and Joy from Cherry Garden for the great and attentive service given during my lunch. No turn down service and air con was a bit weak - otherwise the stay was perfect.",Dec-20,,

It always feels great to be back at Mandarin Oriental. Staycation here is a regular or almost annual affair since my kids were young. However, the last we stayed here was probably 3 to 4 years ago as the kids became teens, they aren't as keen in staycations anymore.   After not visiting for few years, the feeling of sweet nostalgia swarmed us when we enter the hotel. Everything is still the same and seems so familiar. The cheerful and friendly staffs at the reception were always eager to serve. Aisyah, a pretty and cheerful lady checked us in and brought us up to our room.   The Marina Bay room view is superb.

Some pictures of the complementary breakfast and dinner attached. Food was great considering it was free of charge. Signing up for fans of MO also gave us 2 free drinks with our meal so I recommend that. Facilities were by reservation only so nothing was too  crowded, felt quite safe as there was more than enough space for everyone to distance themselves. Late checkout at 6pm was also a very nice touch for staycation. Overall highly recommend for anyone. 3 day 2 night stay.",Oct-20,,
"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",Dec-20,2,Not suitable for vegetarians,"We booked a 2D1N stay including breakfast and dinner. We called ahead to inform the hotel of our dietary requirements (vegetarian) and they said they will make sure there is something for us to eat. To our disappointment the only vegetarian dinner options was pasta with tomato sauce - which I can't really consider a dinner option when I am staying at a Mandarin Oriental. Pasta with tomato sauce basically means there are no vegetarian options, and even though we had called ahead, the hotel didn't take our dietary requirements seriously. The disastrous dinner experience continued at breakfast, where there was a vegetarian curry + prata option. Usually I love eating prata for breakfast but this one was clearly a frozen prata that was just put in the toaster. The curry tasted likeâ€¦",Nov-20,,

Every staff was exceptional - check in, luggage delivery, cleaning, restaurant, spa.... I had encounters with at least 10-15 staff and every single one was able to easily anticipate my needs without being over the top.    The City View suite was very spacious for our 2 kids and 2 adults.  The beds are soft (which I love), the blackout curtains perfect, the aircon very quiet and easy to use.  The only comment is that the design is a bit dated, but some could appreciate the classic design.  The swimming pool, although not particularly large, has a luxurious layout with cabanas, lounge, and beautiful views of the bay.

Breakfast buffet was elaborate and the best I've experienced (and I am in the hotel industry and have traveled to many international hotels), as they showcased Western, Chinese and Indian buffet choices to please a large audience. The most memorable experience was being greeted every morning at the Melt CafÃ© by ""Jihan Febrero"" as her big smile warmed my heart and made my boyfriend and myself feel so welcomed - we loved the delicious mango she delivered to our table.

The inside of the hotel has a full height atrium from ground floor all the way to the roof.  All the rooms open into the atrium so the hotel gives off a very airy and bright feeling.  We visited the hotel pool with our 5 year old son.  The pool is big and is suitable for families with children.  We had a great time playing in the pool.

The staff were genuinely helpful and happy to see us and to ensure we enjoyed our stay.  When we entered the room, we were treated to a panaromic view of Singapore icons of Marina Bay Sands, Art Science Museum and the Flyer. The room itself was claasicly tasteful and elegant and we never felt more comfortable.  The hotel's location was another reason why we chose it.

We were celebrating our daughter's birthday and the hotel surprised her with balloons, a delicious chocolate cake and a cute present from housekeeping. We really enjoyed our time at the pool and eating in the various restaurants. If you plan on eating in the hotel, I would recommend making your reservation at least a week in advance. Breakfast was tasty and generous though a little slow at times but that is understandable considering the extra work required to provide an a la carte vs a buffet breakfast.

This is definitely greatly appreciated!  Suffice to say, we all had a good night sleep!  Pool reservation is for 2hr slot and is great as some hotels only offer an hour of swimming time. We had our dinner at the Melt cafe which was included in the booking. Food wise, nothing outstanding.  However, we received such impeccable service from Alex ( if I remembered the name correctly ) .

The recent stay left us with better moments as the housekeeping team actively checked in on us. Although itâ€™s pretty strange that the baby cot was left out for both stays but a phone call away makes it easy and quick for the team to react.   I canâ€™t rave enough on the service.

In that time there has been some tremendous changes with the Mandarin Oriental being surrounded by new hotels and attractions.  Some of these may have modern decor but the MO still has class with superb and outstanding service from its staff, even when they are at their busiest.  This service starts at the very front with the doorman's greeting when he opens the door of your taxi, and continues through to all other areas of the hotel.  We stayed in a club room with fantastic views over Marina Bay. If you can afford the club experience it is well worth the extra.

The main purpose of our trip was to celebrate our elder girlâ€™s birthday which we informed the hotel beforehand.

Despite we are staying in for the weekend, we managed to get our rooms at 12PM without any signs of queues and was given a late-check out of 2PM. On the next morning, we made a casual request if we could stay a lil longer if possible and they kindly gave us a 4PM late-check out, which many hotels couldn't do even if you have elite status.   The rooms are not the best design or quality to be honest, as some of the design is a lil dated and it is a pity that the TV still requires HDMI (which they gave one to every room btw so that's not too bad actually) and no nespresso machine.

He is so happy that he has his own fuzzy kids size mandarin oriental slippers as well which is a lovely touch by the hotel to pay attention to their little guests as well. Enjoyed the meals at the hotel and the cocktails at MO bar are good too. The only issue is to try to ask for a better view room next time as they did not mention that there was no view at all (mainly rooftop of suntec city) even though I requested for a high floor room with a view.

It was hard to decipher, and I thought-if this is MO, shouldnâ€™t they have a more standard, computerized printout?

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,â€œYet Another Great Stayâ€,"We have stayed at many hotels in Singapore from The Raffles, The Fullerton and Marina Bay Sands and find the location of the Swissotel Stamford to be wonderful. There are lots of shops and eating options below the hotel, which I would highly recommend. MRT is also below the hotel.  We again had a Crest Suit located on the 64th floor, they have been newly renovated and they are very spacious and have fantastic views.  The longe area for breakfast is fantastic and being on the 65th floor has fantastic views of Singapore, 64th floor has direct access to the lounge.  Overall I would recommend this property fir lots of reasons.  Staff were accommodating and the housekeeping staff do a wonderful job, our room was always clean by the time  we got back and it was super clean, and thatâ€™sâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,"Lovely hotel, excellent customer care.","I stayed at this hotel between end of Feb to early March 2020. The staff were very attentive and efficient. Anti bacterial gel was provided in all general area for example at the lift, and in the breakfast room.  The reception area was refurbished and looks amazing. There's a new cafe in the lounge, an amazing tea place with all types of tea, pastries and good food. It is a gem.  The rooms were refurbished too, but I feel like the colours used especially in the hotel corridors are to dull and sad. Plus the corridors had a damp smell,  not sure if it was due to a water leakage under the carpeting. They might have to check that out.  All in all I enjoyed my stay, forward to visiting soon, hopefully.",Mar-20,,

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,1 night stay at Swissotel the Stamford,"It's been a long time since I stayed in the hotel and they had a massive renovation in terms of the room. Very modern and looks new. Location is fantastic (right above City Hall MRT station which is central and connects both the East-West and North-South lines). Great view of Marina Bay Sands area (if possible, book a Harbour view room and request for room series 53 for the best view). Was plesantly upgraded to an Executive room with Lounge access. Lounge is spacious and food had a good variety. The lounge even serves Champagne Laurent-Perrier (if i'm not mistaken) during the daily 530-730pm Happy hour. Truly value for money and slightly less expensive compared to Fairmont hotel next door. Will definitely be back!",Mar-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,We shall be back!!,"This hotel was one of our most loveliest stays! When we first entered the lobby, we felt a sudden rush of euphoria. Conveniently connected to the MRT (just downstairs - you do not even need to exit outside), the location was perfect from major tourist attractions, only a few stops away from Orchard road and Marina Bay. The hotel is also connected to a shopping centre (with money exchange - although the best money exchange is in Chinatown CK department store), and below is a food court with an incredible variety of food options as well as an array of international restaurants. Hotel check-in was very efficient (since it was a self-computerised) and all the staff were very friendly, polite and helpful throughout our stay. Rooms were spacious, immaculate and wonderful withâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Not perfect but damn close!,"This was the last hotel in a long list as we travelled from Spain via London to Australia and back.  It may have been the last but, on balance, it was the best.  But first the negatives, albeit minor.  The so-called self-service check-in and out is chaotic and off-putting as you arrive. It neither engenders a warm welcome on arrival nor a warm, happy feeling of being a valued guest on departure.  It's not self-serve but you're expected to do it yourself under a member of staff's watchful eye.  After a long journey, rather than being expected to work under supervision, I like to be welcomed by a pleasant receptionist behind her desk, doing it for me whilst, ideally, I sip a complimentary drink in the bar.  Not here.   Another weird thing was the concierge service.  When we askedâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Lovely hotel to stay in,"Was there for a staycation - clean and well-furnished room with good sound proofing. Not to mention the view from the room, awesome!   Just a minute setback, it was self check-in and check-out. There was a hotel staff to assist us with the check-in so it was not a problem. But when we checked out, there was no staff to assist and there were no clear instructions on what to do with the room cards.   Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and I will definitely be back.",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,2,Great hotel for tourists not for locals,Guests who drives are discouraged from booking this room as there isnt any complimentary parking. Recommend to stay at other hotel within the vicinity as it is cheaper and has parking lot for hotel guests.,Mar-20,,

Add to this the delights of exquisite service with none of the conceit that usually goes with it, great value for money and location - you have the Swissotel of Singapore!",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Cannot be beaten for outstanding service and hospitality in Singapore,"We have stayed at The Stamford for many years and have always enjoyed excellent service along with their genuine warmth and welcoming attitude from the staff.  A considerable number of employees have been working at the Hotel for many years and it is a pleasure to see their friendly faces each time we return.  Now that the Hotel's renovations have been completed the spacious Rooms and facilities represent the best in comfort and value throughout the industry in Singapore. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized for a week and during that period, the staff from Level 65 were very helpful, caring and compassionate towards my wife during this worrying time, which was greatly appreciated by both of us and our heartfelt thanks go out to all members of staff. We wish the Hotel Managementâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Best location in the city!,"We stayed here for six nights over the new year.  Phenomenal location!  The MRT is downstairs in the adjacent mall with both the red line and the green line (to Chiang Airport) right there.  The mall's basement is all food shops, so you can try the Singapore Kaya toast, noodles, a proper English breakfast, and a 24 hour McDonalds for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  There's TWG Tea shop on the main floor with a lovely afternoon tea, but be sure to go to the bar or restaurants on the 70th floor -- amazing views (all three take reservations -- including the bar and the Michelin starred restaurant).  Standard rooms with all the desirables:  robes/slippers, blowdryer, tea/coffee, refrigerator, wide selection of toiletries.  Raffles Hotel is right across the street --be sure to try aâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,Not our usual choice of hotel style but perfect for NYE View - wow!,"BOY does this hotel cater for the masses! It is like one MAMMOTH cruise ship just turned on its end!!!!  It does this well though, and whilst a 1000-room hotel isnâ€™t something we would normally sign-up for, this short stay was purely for marina view purposes for the NYE fireworks from the balcony of our room - and it delivered VERY nicely!!! From level 53 we couldnâ€™t have seen the show from a better and more perfect vantage point.  So thanks Swissotel for a great NYE!   We were impressed, actually, that on such an intensely busy night for the hotel the two in-room requests that we called guest services about were attended to. A bucket of ice arrived pretty swiftly (albeit that they initially forgot the two champagne glasses, but the guy did rectify that and returned withinâ€¦",Dec-19,,

Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,5,A Great Escape From the Hustle and Bustle (SingapoRediscovers Voucher),"Walked over from another a night at a brand name hotel in the vicinity with high expectations for our first experience in a five-stars establishment. Was not disappointed. Called a few days before to confirm my stay and was asked if I had downloaded the Grand Park City Hall (GPCH) app. Quite bespoke actually as it serves as a hotel room key and a remote control for the lights, ceiling fan and airconditioning in the room.   Although I was told over the phone that my earliest check-in time was 6pm due to Safe Management Measures, I requested if I could do an early check-in. Granted it was a Saturday, I thought my luck worked. I was asked to come between 1pm and 1.30pm. I also managed to pre-book the use of the swimming pool and gym (2-hour slots i.e 3-5pm, 5-7pm etc) and breakfastâ€¦",Dec-20,,

Grand Park City Hall,Jan-20,3,Good value but awful technology!,"Overall this is a nice hotel. Good location, tasteful decor, and a really nice breakfast. I feel like the value for money is good. The bar seems quite expensive, with it hard to find a spirit below SG$20 from memory - oh well, go and have a drink somewhere else. But the major thing that is going to unfortunately sour my whole experience? The overuse of technology! Want to go to your room in the lift? Well there are no buttons for the accommodation floors. You've got to tap your card, then push an option on the touch-screen. Ok once you know, but no one advised me of this. Want to get to the garden deck up the top? Only half of the lifts go there, but you don't know which ones until you're inside, with no signage to alert you. And the worst bit: the controls in the rooms. Asâ€¦",Jan-20,,

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,4,excellent service recovery; well renovated central hotel,"Edit: GPCH contacted me on the same day I posted the review. Cheryl Chan, the Service Manager did an excellent job of service recovery. She was apologetic for the air-conditioning and long wait @ check-in, assured me that this was not the hotelâ€™s usual standards and said the hotel will ensure future visits would be well taken care of. I appreciated her speedy service recovery and genuine attitude. I will definitely consider visiting the hotel again.   It was a rather disappointing stay.   The check-in process was inefficient.

Check in was confusing and they were made to wait. It seems that hotel staff lacks communication. Was told to go to level 9 direct to check in but was not told if require card access. Also, it would be comforting if the staff can make the family more welcome by letting them know on complimentary drinks served at L9 while waiting. It doesnt help if u have angsty family member. Requested for a cake to be served in the room prior to arrival but got served after. I did not request for any rah rahs to be done up in the room either. Just-a-cake.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,4,View ðŸ‘ Location ðŸ‘ Breakfast ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,"Gorgeous views (if overlooking the harbor), perfect location, dezent rooms but busy, loud breakfast, sometimes with annoyingly long lines till you get a table and in our experience something was always empty and it took ages until it was refilled (if at all} - e.g. bagels were really hard to get, sometimes just one self-service coffee station would work (for 100s of guests)",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,1,Disappointment,This hotel is not the same as it used to be 7 years back..this was my 3rd visit to the hotel with my family and i was hugely disappointed in the fact that they have reduced the size of their rooms after Restructuring the building..there were ants in the breakfast buffet area..highlight was our bathroom sink getting choked and their service staff had to be continuously called to get it working..also mini bar was not stocked at all..they donâ€™t keep tea spoons in the room anymore for tea or coffee and their buffet breakfast is a huge disappointment..also i felt they were a little put off by seeing Indians.We are never going to this place again and would advice fellow travellers to please reconsider before booking here,Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Unsurpassed Service,"From the moment we walked in the hotel we were treated like royalty as the staff were so respectful, helpful and just plain nice!!  The recent upgrade of the facilities was amazing and want to thank Sahull Ahmad who is the Duty Manager there for his impeccable service that should be emulated by all staff there as it was 10/10.  The care and attention to detail in everything he did for us was very special and appreciated.",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,1,Vrey poor Room service & cleanliness,"very poor room service, ahve to wait for 1 hour for coffee, cleaners did not claened the room- rubbish was left in the room, lenin was not changed.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,"Large room, amazing view and good location","We stayed at Swissotel The Stamford twice in December 2019. On the first stay, we got room 5454 on the 54th floor and on the second visit we got 6254. The rooms seemed quite identical in setup and size so the following review is for both rooms. The lobby area is a bit strange as it is not really a traditional lobby. There is a center desk where the idea is to do your own check in but there were staff to help out with the process.  When coming into the hotel room, you first see a place to put the suitcase and a wardrobe together with a safe in the drawer below the suitcase storage space. But walking just a bit further in, it was the view that took all the attention. The room had a direct view to the entire Marina Bay area with the downtown skyscrapers and Marina Bay Sands hotel.â€¦",Dec-19,,

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,4,Generally very good,"We stayed here for 3 nights in February in a family suite. This suite is essentially two adjoining rooms with a room more themed for children.  The rooms were modern and clean, I liked that the mini bar was complimentary which is uncommon nowadays and helpful in a city where it's not unusual to be charged S$20 (twenty) for a beer.  The bed in the adults room was huge and comfy, we had great sleep throughout the holiday.  I liked that in the adults bathroom there was a choice between hand held and rain type shower, good for a couple that have seperate preferences on shower types!  We ate breakfast in the crystal club each morning. The selection didn't change when we were there but there was ample selection for our family. I didn't like the crispy American style bacon or the factâ€¦",Feb-20,,

After a few hours - finally a room was found, however no quite what we thought we had paid for!! Upon asking the next day if we were to be moved to the deluxe room that weâ€™d paid for and getting a â€˜no thatâ€™s all availableâ€™ decided not to push further.

When we returned after cruising, we were faced with an extended stay. One of us stayed at the hotel and one went to the hospital. Our fellow cruisers went home! What could have been an unhappy experience turned into a heartwarming time all due to the Swissotel staff who were caring, friendly and very helpful.

I requested a room with a nice view but I received one on the back of the hotel. I didn't want a room with a harbour view, but not either to see a big building in front of my eyes. After I asked for change I got one with a better view. The room looks great but has few places to store the clothes, the baggage... On the first room we got, the spot light fell from the ceiling.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Elevated Experience on Level 65,"I've stayed in multiple Accor properties in Singapore, but nothing compares to the Swissotel The Stamford.  The amazing staff at level 65 will ensure that your stay here will be nothing short but flawless, from the time you checked in to the very moment you check out.  The personalised service and remembering my preferences is outstanding.  Awesome views from the room and the lounge, especially at night ( looking at the Marina Bay)!  Aside from the view, the suite was wonderful. Spacious and thoughtfully designed. Futuristic controls and overside bathtub.   The absolute best part of our stay was meeting the staff of the Club Lounge. Divyya, the Club Lounge level Assistant manager and Stella, both are above professional.

Not enough staff to help out during check in time.,Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,High tech and refined - like a Swiss watch,"As part of Accor, this was always going to be in the running for me because Iâ€™m in their program and they do hotels well. Even so this place exceeded expectations with the pared back but tech forward refit which really sets it apart. Also a rarity is the balcony we got, I mean who expects a balcony in a Singapore hotel! Service was great and location could only be beaten if it were at Marina Bay. Walk was only 15 mins to Garden by the Bay anyhow though. Also itâ€™s right next to The Raffles Long Bar and thatâ€™s worthy of a visit. Canâ€™t be faulted really.",Jan-20,,

We explained that we had to â€œscan documentâ€ per the steps on automated screen and so we tried scanning the letter we had but failed.  The lady at Concierge impatiently replied us â€œscan your ICâ€ and we went â€œoh scan IC..â€ and she even â€œya your ICâ€. We were shocked that she used singlish which totally lacks professionalism especially at a 5* hotel. She didnâ€™t even bother to offer any help or direct us to her colleagues. True enough, the scanner doesnâ€™t work and instead we approached her other colleague for help who had to scan our ID few times. The self check-in may be efficient but lacks personal touch and the â€œscan documentâ€ step is vague. Disappointingâ€¦",Jan-20,,

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,Always the best view in town,"I will always stay in this hotel when in Singapore, which is 3/4 times a year, but unfortunately every time is getting a bit worse. I really miss the old Swissotel. The furniture are placed badly, you are sitting back to the view ( crazy). The worst is the corner room, why is the table taking half of the room, who need this, especially whiteout the chairs. Your winner is the view, hire some good interior designers and have the best of it.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Awesome Hotek,"Great location. Raffles City Shopping is just steps away. The staff were friendly and helpful. Most impressed to meet Eddy Tan in the Lobby.

Even the bell hop delivered my belongings with a warm smile and a big bow. The room is thoughtfully designed and the harbour view from the room was breath taking. It was then I realised how beautiful Singapore is. Drinks at the Skai lounge was relaxing with a nice ambience and magnificent View. Breakfast at the Clove was awesome too. Spread was good and service was efficient.  Overall, it was a perfect 10 stay and I will go back to the hotel again for my next stay without doubts.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,3,Holiday in Singapore,Good hotel well located to attractions and transport both MRT and train. Not the usual high quality breakfast as it was moved to the Fairmont (supposedly due to renovations). Noting this was during the Coronavirus time it may have been another reason. Concierge was really good in arranging a Segway tour for us. Highly recommend this mini Segway tour. I would stay at this hotel again.,Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel never fails to impress.  The staff are exceptional.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,First Class Hotel - Great Experience,"Stayed at Swissotel Stamford from 26th Feb for 5 nights whilst visiting old friends in Singapore. From the moment I arrived until the moment I left, I received service nothing short of excellent.    Nothing is too much trouble for staff; accommodating at all times. Room was large, comfortable and with superb views. Poolside was a lovely place to relax and kick back without being too quiet. Breakfast was simply divine with something to suit everyone.  If I had to find a fault, I would suggest that the WiFi could be a little stronger, particularly at the poolside. But that's being picky! Overall, one of the most pleasant stays I have ever had and I look forward to my next visit in two years.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,4,Itâ€™s worth it,"A pleasant stay at Swissotel Stamford Singapore, with two-sided views.  The rooms are quite spacious. Complete facilities.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,2,The worst check in experience!,"We arrived at Hotel at 2:40pm after a long night flight from Dubai. At the self check in desk, a guy (his name is Jia Cheng)came over to assist us. After he checked us in, he told us to come back at 3 because check in time is 3. So we had some lunch and came back around 3:30. For some reason he still couldnâ€™t issue room key for us, he saidâ€give me a minuteâ€ then disappeared. We were standing in the lobby for more than 30 minutes before he appeared again. His manner was rude and unprofessional and we were given a worst possible room. We called the hotel and ask to change another room, we were told no rooms available, not even next day. But next day after I talked to a lady called Aiko and showed her the pictures of the room I took, she helped us to change to a nice big room withâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,Staycation,"Has decided to try this hotel for a short staycation last weekend. Booked a Executive King room and club benefits was included. View from the room was fantastic and room was spacious and comfortable, believe that they might have renovated the rooms recently. Club lounge was spacious and plenty of food choices during the happy hours. Staff were friendly and efficient. Gave us a few choices for breakfast and we decided to try Prego. However realised that the restaurant staffs is only clearing plates for guest that has already had their breakfast and already left instead of clearing the plates for guests that are in the midst of dining. But the whole stay was pleasant and will consider for our next trip.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,sets the standard for hospitality with class,"every hotel staff we met and talked to throughout our stay was friendly, warm and attentive, and conducted themselves with utmost professionalism. the room and bathroom are extremely clean and comfortable, and designed with excellent user experience in mind. the bed and linen are first class comfortable, and we couldnâ€™t have asked for a more breathtaking expansive can-never-get-old views that kept changing and shimmering with the moody colours of the sky throughout the day. who needs netflix? weâ€™d like to thank eddy and jason for their hospitality and attentiveness in ensuring we were well taken from the time we stepped into your lovely hotel",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,3,No Romance Here,"This property is well located and is great if you are looking for efficiency and good quality at affordable rates. Views are spectacular, and the Skai Bar is great for an expensive drink. But don't expect a true five-star experience here. It's a big hotel that feels like a big hotel: public spaces (lobby, restaurants, lounge) are noisy and crowded, and there is little in the way of a personal touch. Staff is friendly but not all quite understand their jobs completely. Spa experience was pricey but enjoyable.",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent,Extremely well located - walking distance to th Bay and Clark Quay. The Willowstream spa and gym are the best I have encountered.

It was a fantastic stay and the team made us feel as very valued guests. Especially Miriam and the team in the Lounge at floor 65 made this a truly memorable stay for us.  The location is perfect, everything seems to be located close to the hotel. The metro station is outside the building and a couple of taxis are always parked upfront the hotel.  The kids loved the two pools and enjoyed having dinner by the pool bar.  So there is no question if we return to the Swissotel The Stamford, the question is when. Can I recommend the hotel to other guests? YES.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,Mar 2020 staycation,"Gotten a room facing the Marina Bay and pandang. Nice view as per usual. Just a side note.  Would be good if the hotel management shows a bit more appreciation for a Accor diamond member staying in-house (that drives). At the bare minimum, provides complimentary parking, whether itâ€™s a free valet or given a daily parking voucher for the entire stay. On the whole, itâ€™s still a pleasant stay minus the car parking issue.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Perfect for exploring,"We travel with 3 small kids. This was our 3 rd stay at this hotel and this time we were upgraded to Harbour view room.

Started the check in process at around 7pm and even 1.5 hours later, i still did not have a room. This is despite rooms are meant to be available after 3pm.   Appeared staff did not know which room key to provide to us. We were even handed keys for a room which was already occupied by another party (but the staff were not aware of this). Beyond ridiculous.",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,REACHING NEW HEIGHTS,"Thank heavens we chose this hotel over others. Stunning views, efficient service, variety of catering options, fantastic location but, above all, the most friendly and professional staff. Not just a hotel, but a home from home too. Luckily we were on 60th and 61st floor and had access to Club Lounge. My only suggestion here would be some lighter/standard canapes in addition to the current offering. And what better than have dream-like views of the water, skyscrapers, Marina Bay complex, a thousand ships in the harbour juxtaposed with the old; cricket, tennis, the cathedral and Clarke Quay. Tip: spoil yourself and book a Marina Bay View Room. Thank you to everyone who looked after us so well. A brilliant team.",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,Birthday Staycation,"Instead of going overseas for the birthday celebration, we choose to stay home and have a birthday staycation instead.

We stayed on a high floor and had an amazing view out towards the Marina. Rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The staff were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is a sister hotel with the Fairmont, which is next door. The hotels share their bars and restaurants so there are a large number of places to eat and drink that you can charge back to your room. The hotels share the pool and gym but they did not seem overcrowded. We have stayed at quite a few hotels in Singapore but we would definitely stay here, or at the Fairmont, again because of the quality of the hotels and the fantastic location.",Jan-20,,

Would definitely stay here every time we visit Singapore.",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,Fantastic Views,This is a great hotel to stay in Singapore.  It is central to everything and must have one of the best views of the city going.  The only down side was that we were three adults and the room we were originally given was a double room.  Once I complained and we were given an appropriate room then all was very good indeed.  The Sky Bar has stunning views and the food court in the basement has stunning food.,Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,We Love This Hotel,"It is always a pleasure to write about a property that reaches this level of quality and service. We love this place as it is always our first choice in Singapore, and one of our very favourite stays around the world. From the moment you arrive, the class is on show. From the beautifully dressed doorman to the effortless check in. There is always someone nearby who genuinely wants to help you.  There is an elegant Tea Shop right there in the lobby that adds a lovey touch of sophistication. Our room has always been great here, and our family and friends also choose to stay SHS. What a view. The best of Singapore was right in front of us, and as sunset eased in our view turned into a glittering sea of light. As it was my wife's 50th, where else in the world would we choose toâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,3,Not a bad choice for Singapore,"I have stayed at the Swissotel or the neighbouring Fairmont Hotel many times over the years on business trips. The Swissotel has always been a popular hotel with cruise tours and flight crew and is generally busier than the Fairmont. It is conveniently located and the rooms have all been renovated, so no complaints in that regard. However, I won't be returning any time soon. Everything works well enough - apart from the annoying new lighting and aircon systems which I could never quite work out - but I won't be returning.  The hotel has lost interface with its guests and management seems to have forgotten the fact they are in a service business, not just turning around customers as quickly as possible. My main complaint is the new check in and check out system. No personalâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,Our go-to hotel in Singapore,"Our family had a 1 night stoopver due to flights not connecting and have stayed here previously.  We had a lovely refurbished room overlooking Marina Bay Sands - was a perfect view of the fireworks that night and the Bay.  Staff and service were all very helpful to assist us with check in and organising a departure taxi.  We enjoyed our welcome drinks around the pool and the kids had a good time swimming there.  The breakfast buffet was just an amazing selection and extremely well presented.  Definitely our go-to hotel in Singapore.  A couple of niggles - there weren't enough towels in the room.  Only 2 sets despite having booked in as 4 people.  Also still waiting nearly 1 week later for the $100 ""hold"" on my credit card, which is actually showing as a charge to be refunded. â€¦",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,3,Disappointed Stay as Housekeeping took long hours to clean the room,"Stayed for 3N and every day Housekeeping took hours to clean the room. Understand that hotel will be getting their staff to go on leave in view of low occupancy during these period but hotel should still manage their manpower as this issue was not present in another hotel during this period as well. Regardless what time we went out for breakfast (8 plus, 9 plus or 10 plus) our room will only be available after 3pm! This is way too long! Didn't expect such standard in a 5 stars hotel.",Mar-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,4,First Class Hotel,"A cut above most of hotels in this category. Everywhere was perfectly clean. All of the staff were helpful and professional. The breakfast was first class with many choices. My only reservation was the price of the food in the hotel restaurants. With the competition for food outlets in Singapore, I'm surprised that any of the guests at the hotel dine in their restaurants. Adjacent to the hotel is Raffles City. There are restaurants on the ground floor that cater for every possible taste at a fraction of the hotel prices. After saying this, I suppose if you stay at a 4-5 star hotel you should expect to pay prices that reflect the status. In a nutshell, it is a first class hotel with first services. By all means enjoy the ambience, the welcome and the breakfast. However, unlessâ€¦",Feb-20,,

The staff in the lounge do an amazing job from reception to the cooks at breakfast all friendly nothing was to hard or a bother.  The  food in the lounge changed every ngt there was a variety of sushi  cheeses calamari gnocchi, tortellini, chicken dishes and many more.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Great location and hotel!,Right in the middle of Singapore! Great location with connections through the mall underneath the hotel to MRT and other malls.   Attentive and helpful staff.   Rooms are huge! And modern. The balcony was locked and I asked them to unlock it and it was no problem.   Big comfortable beds and coffee machine.   I really enjoyed staying here and would definitely stay again.   Only downside was they wanted to hold a huge amount on my credit card â€œin case I ordered room serviceâ€. I understand itâ€™s common practice but they wanted $400! I just refused and they said ok. Weird.   Apart from that no complaints at all.,Oct-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,6 Day getaway,"This is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are large and very clean, we were lucky to have an ocean view room looking at the Marina Bay Hotel. The hotel was a perfect location for our time in Singapore, we were able to walk to all the attractions we wanted to visit. You are surrounded by quality shops and eateries, the complementary breakfast was a wonderful arrangement of foods from around the world, we actually tried new foods. We booked the High Tea which is served at a restaurant on the 70th floor, we can recommend this as a must do, the views are amazing and the high tea is beautiful.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Everything youâ€™ll need,"We stayed here from 2-5 January and would highly recommend this hotel. We got a great deal through Accor and were in a premier harbour view king room. The view was amazing from the 56th floor and everything in the room was 1st class. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, the breakfast was vast and the staff always helpful. There is a mall under the hotel where you could get anything you desire from restaurants, drinks(beerðŸ˜) banking and supermarket.  Overall, one of the best hotels, in the best location and reasonably priced. Will definitely stay here again if/when we return",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Very good,"We stayed here for New Years and we really enjoyed it. The hotel is very good and in very good location in close proximity to marina bay and other attractions. The room was very comfortable, quiet and clean. The bed was very comfortable. We got a room on 61st floor and the view from the room was great. The breakfast was good and it wasnâ€™t too busy for the period we stayed here. The only negative was check in process. You can do self check in which was fine with us but couldnâ€™t work properly so needed assistance anyway. We booked New Years package at the Skai Bar and we were happy with the service and quality of food and drinks. Overall would definitely recommend it.",Dec-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,1st time at Swissotel,"I was happy with my short stay at the Swissotel. What I liked: room size and layout, lighting and sensor activated night light, comfortable bed, central location, connected to Raffles city, breakfast buffet spread, service. I give the bathroom a B though because of the open style shower stall so water splashes out.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for both business and non business visitors.",Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,4,Nice view great service,Staff were friendly upon check in.  Room was nice and view from the hotel was great. Breakfast was good as well as great evening cocktail at the club lounge.  The Only shortfall is the carpark which room staying guest doesnâ€™t have any complimentary parking facilities. Valet comes with a price tag of $30 which is not favourable for guest who drove.,Feb-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,May-20,5,Comfortable and good facilities,We stayed two nights in a Premier King room to break our trip on the way to the UK.  I really can't fault the hotel and the staff were very helpful and friendly. It is in a   convenient location and connected to a Mall. Breakfasts are busy with plenty of room and choice of food. We also had access to the Business lounge which was useful. We tried the Skai bar one night for a pre dinner drink and enjoyed the view from the 70th floor. We have stayed in many hotels in Singapore and this hotel has been one of the best overall.,Jun-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,Amazing and spectacular!!,Thank you to the wonderful team at the Swissotel Stamford Singapore. Finding a hotel to accomodate our family of 7 was made so easy with this hotel. From the Reservation process through to all the extra thougtfulness and efficiencies - this was an amazing facility I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. The cleanliness and comfort is second to none. The view from our room on the 60th floor will forever be etched in our memories. The pool facilities are perfect and combine the hotel/resort feel. The location is perfect to be positioned as a tourist family with young children. Special thanks to all the wonderful team at Executive Lounge. Starting with Sara who welcomed us like we were family.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,4,Loved every second of my stay,Had been here from 31st March to 4th April and it was such a pleasant experience. The room I stayed was on Floor 37 and the views of the city from there is simply amazing. However since i was there for a company event the food that was served was mostly for a group and so it had its ups and downs which could be understood considering we were a large group so no complaints there.  The room was absolutely fantastic. Since it was a first time for me to find so much of automation in the room it was quite nice. There's mood lighting in the room and the bathroom was squeaky clean. I have to tell you I loved my stay there and felt that the hospitality inspite of the size of our group was simply exceptional. Keep it up Swissotel!!

Receptionist were superb, professional and friendly (god I felt like prince Charles!).   Although we walked in to our hotel room and the maintenance team was still in there working, we were quickly given another room without waiting any longer. Spacious room and beautifully done.   We were given chocolate and fruit platter because of the stuff up during check in but hey who doesnt make mistake? We thoroughly loved our stay here. From the friendly concierge to room attended and even to the maintenance guys who were in our room during check in, they were all so polite and so humble.  We checked out and they even come and say sorry again.  We are already planning to come back!",Aug-19,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,A place that make you feel more than welcome.,"Firstly, the best asset of the hotel is the staff. Especially the staff at level 65. Miriam, Devynna (if I get the name right) and Adikin are superb and friendly. No matter how busy they are, they still put on their smile and fulfill all of the guestsâ€™ requests.   Check in is smooth at level 65 as we have have booked the signature suite room. We were upgraded to the nice vitality room. The room is equipped with some simple exercise equipments that somehow forced us to work a little â€œharderâ€ in keeping ourselves in shape during our stay there.  It was a pleasant and great stay for us and surprisingly even with covid 19, the hotel is rather full. I guess this shows how good the Swissotel reputation is in the industry.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,5,A great stay in a room with a fantastic view,Book a room on high floors.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,3,"Great location, poor housekeeping","Everything is excellence in this hotel including its location, easy check in/out service, the room is spacious, breakfast variety except their housekeeping service. It is to my disappointment that even I have put a message to remind that the body lotion needed to be refilled, the housekeep simpliy just ignored and did not refil it after cleaning the room. Also they did not clean properly a used tea spoon that I could still see the stain on it. It is definitely not a five start hotel standard.",Jan-20,,
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Feb-20,3,"Good location, more functional than luxury, great TWG shop in the foyer","Comfortable rooms. Breakfast was very ordinary but room service and the bistro were quite good. The foyer is congested and it can be difficult to get assistance from the concierge at busy times. When you do find the staff, they are quite helpful.  It is worth spending some time in the TWG shop in the foyer. Some lovely teas and serving sets.",Jan-20,,

There were a few specks of dust near the entrance but itâ€™s (almost) forgivable.  Dinner at Skai Restaurant was delicious, 3 set meal + a bottle of Malbec, a Singapore Slings and a Negroni was absolutely under SGD 450.- perfect. Massive shout out to June and Leo for attending to our every needs. Both of you deserve a pay raise.

We were extremely satisfied that we decided to choose this hotel during our stay in Singapore. The location was great as it was along Clarke Quay where there was buzzing night life. The facilities were wonderful, clean and spacious. We were so comfortable after our long flight from Europe - the bed was soft and spacious. The room was large too allowing us to fit our portable cot with space to spare. It just felt easy and comforable travelling with a young child at this hotel. The pool was great and we were able to utilise washing/drying options as well as dry cleaning. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.

The harbor view rooms on the high rise floors offer an amazing view of the city. Rooms are spacious as compared to other hotels in Singapore.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,2,A squash and a squeeze!,"Itâ€™s probably unfair to compare but this was a disappointing experience after the pleasure of staying in family run, smaller, more personal, less expensive, better organised hotels, with more spacious rooms in Vietnam. We had booked a family room which we assumed meant we would all get a bed of some sort, (my children are young teenagers). On arrival at 2 am (and I echo everyoneâ€™s comments regarding the extremely poor check in system) we were advised they would bring us an extra roller bed as a family room only had one king size bed as standard??!!

In spite of it being so busy and coming to a public holiday, the staff were fantastic. They checked us in very efficiently through a very modern face recording system. Then we were shown to our very comfortable room. The hotel had made full allowance for the very busy public holiday and ensured we (and all the other guests) could get meals and room service throughout our stay.  Full marks to the whole team, I would certainly recommend them.",Jan-20,,

We didn't even need to ask about check in, he had it all ready to go for us. The check in process was very quick and easy and before we knew it, we were in our room and our bags were delivered.

Convenient for public transport foe the City Hall MRT station is a short walk with the Esplanade station a little further, but via covered walkways. Also there is a massive food court in the basement of the property and there are numerous up-market eats within short walking distance.  Small but important pointer for the Hotel management. We stayed in room 4663 and the hot/cold water for the shower is plumbed the incorrect way round. Dangerous if you have kids of people with disability.",Feb-20,,

Quite disturbing to hear the door closing outside and you can hear housekeeping cleaning at the next door in the morning. Need to enhance the sound proof. However, Housekeeping is doing a good job.  The gym is great. But the condition of some equipments need to be maintained eg:cushion of the equipment need to repair.  The 2 pools are shared with fairmont Hotel.

Even better, they took care of our bags on our last day after check out so we could explore Singapore as our flight didnâ€™t leave until late that night.

I had breakfast included in my room rate - there was a massive variety of food which was all fresh out when I went to the restaurant. Iâ€™m not sure I would pay extra specially to have the breakfast, but this is not a fault of the hotel, more that there are so many quick and cheap options nearby. Pool was also excellent. It was really easy to get the MRT from the airport and again to get to/from Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Taxi to the airport early-ish Saturday morning was around $25.",Feb-20,,

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,4,Our first staycation.,"Overall, it was a good experience. We was given a free upgrade to a room with bathtub upon arrival.

The room amenities are sufficient. Breakfast was wonderful and the staff were very polite in serving us.  Cons: My room have some small little bug roaming around which i don't know where it come from. Didn't quite affect me but i think it's good to sound out. The control panel for the room smart appliances, such as the aircon and fan, is very slow and we are forced to use the app but even so, the app is badly design in a way that after changing settings, it keeps going back to the main page which is rather frustrating. The lift is also confusing to operate as it has both the touch screen panel and button as well as card scanner. Thus, a number of guestâ€¦",Dec-19,,

The only set back about this hotel it is essential to download hotel lighting/aircon app which I didnt. This forced me to be get out of bed and turn off all lights at the control panel before I slept.  Hotel should consider putting another controller by the beside.,Mar-20,,

We stayed for 3 nights, and upon entry we noticed that our toilet was leaking, so we notified staff immediately whoâ€™s said theyâ€™d sent someone to have a look. This was not fixed throughout the entire stay and, to our knowledge, was not even looked at. We notified hotel staff another 3 times and still got nothing.

When I called up the hotel for an explanation, they couldn't explain why I was charged that amount as apparently it was for some transportation service that I never used.  The hotel did not inform me about these charges at the time I checked out and, although the hotel was sending me marketing emails after I had checked-out, they could not inform me of this charge or send me an invoice.

This is a smart hotel where we can simply control in-room facilities (lightings, etc) via the mobile app. The most convenient way was to unlock with the room key via the same app, no need to worry about carrying or losing the room keys anymore!

A Smart hotel that allows guests to control their room lightings etc through their smartphones, it will take a fair bit of getting used to. While it uses technology to its advantage, something to note is that it will take a while for your device to detect and connect to the hotel's wifi.   Do note that while it is located in the city, there is not much of a view. In essence Grand Park City Hall is a hotel in the city but tucked at a quiet corner.

It recently re-opened its doors after a full refurbishment. Was delighted upon entering the rooms. One of our rooms was upgraded by Klook to a junior suite, room 559. It was brand new, and I just love the cosy sofa area where one can relax and have a drink or two. The King bed was very comfortable. The pillows though narrow, provided enough comfort.

My first surprise came when I entered the room. Wrong room was given. A deluxe room without bathtub was given when I booked Premier room with bathtub. I called the reception desk and they took a long while to pick up. After I have conveyed the message, they told me someone will be assigned to my room to assist for a room change. I waited for more than 30 mins for a nice Indian guy to bring me up from room 502 to room 946.  The hotel staff bought me to room 946 and tapped on the door lock.â€¦",Dec-20,,

Grand Park City Hall,Jan-20,4,Nice hotel but a few areas to work on,Check in was supposed to be via the hotel app but it wasn't really working well and hence lengthened the check in process instead.   We booked the family suite with the intention of celebrating my son's birthday. The intention was communicated via the hotel app messenger but it wasn't noted by the hotel which was quite disappointing.   The rooms were nicely renovated however the doors for the connecting rooms are not able to open fully hence it blocks the pathway which doesn't make sense. The management should also try to child proof the kids room as we noted that there are sharp corners on the furnitures. Housekeeping was only done pretty late. We were out from 12-3pm but housekeeping was still not done when we returned.   We enjoyed the food both at Tablescape and the lounge.â€¦,Jan-20,,

When we first stepped into the hotel, we were greeted by an amazing front desk who made sure that we had all we needed to have a comfortable stay (first impression well done!) We also had club access to all day beverages and evening cocktails. Our server, James, even went above and beyond and made a plate of goodies for our birthday girl! That really made us feel special :)   Our Park Suite came with a living room area, bedroom area, steamer, bathtub, and even an outdoor jacuzzi! To give us more of a birthday vibe, the hotel staff even prepared balloons and a small cake for us. Talking about feeling special again!!  The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,4,Christmas Staycation,"We managed to get an early check in and free upgrade  on our room, thanks so much to frontdesk staff Henny. Sheâ€™s super nice and very approachable.  What we like inside our room is the nostalgic feeling and also the bath tub experience. Their bathroom is spacious even with the bath tub. The glass panels in the bathroom is a clever idea to make the room spacious and can watch TV while lying in the bath tub.  There is also a electric blinds installed if you want some privacy.   Small concern we had is the mini fridge not working. We called Henny and they gave us bucket of ice to use for our drinks.

Standard procedure for covid measures were dealt efficiently. It took approx 15 mins for us to be issued with our rooms. â€¢Room was splendid, clean and neat. The interior was tastefully modern. Bed was super comfy, and the pillow was just perfect.

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,Perfect Hotel for staycation with friends,"Booked the Park Suite for a birthday staycation over the weekend. The room was very nice and spacious with a bathtub, steamroom and the greatest highlight was the outdoor private Jacuzzi. It was perfect for a celebration with a small group of friends. The view from the Jacuzzi was amazing as well, with a view of MBS and Esplanade. We also had club access where we can get drinks all day with special cocktail hour in the evening. The staff are very friendly and provided wonderful service to us during our stay.

Well worth the tranquility and outside eating if you wish. Jill, Melody and Judy could not do enough for us. We both had Eggs Benedict/Royale daily with cappuccinoâ€™s for breakfast and divine hot food and cheeses/fruits at 6pm.

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,An unforgettable and wonderful experience,"Stayed for two nights to get away from the worries of work.  From the decor of the rooms to the variety and extravagance of the food, this hotel does seem to have it all. The hotel is designed to compliment both modern and traditional architecture. The inclusion of a high-tech app that allows the user to control the various functions in the room was a innovative and convenient touch.  For the breakfast and cocktail dinner, they both were extremely satisfying in terms of the quality and array of food that was on offer. The friendly and inviting staff also made the stay even more spectacular.

Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,Great value!,"Booked a short stay on the weekends. The hotel is newly renovated, everything looks clean, neat and new. The room interior is really pretty, beds are comfortable and pillows perfect (probably one of the best hotel pillows ever). There is an app for you to control the room facilities and there is a speaker.   The hotel pool is quaint with hydro massage, towels, bottled water and sunbeds. Service is top notch, the staff are super friendly and accommodating.   We had dinner and drinks at the crystal club lounge. Drinks include hard liquor, wine, beer, coffee and soda.

Very impressive with the technology and controlling the room access with the gadget too! The bathroom had a bath, shower and toilet and was also quite large. Water was supplied every day free of charge and the bed was very comfortable. Attractive pool area but unfortunately unable to use at this moment. Would return to this hotel.

Breakfast though was always nice.",Mar-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,4,Great location and pleasant stay,"The room was ready ahead of the usual check in time. Housekeeping had forgotten to leave us towels but everything was sorted out eventually. Despite booking a pool slot, there was a 10-minute wait just to access the pool. The Crystal Club had good food options for evening cocktails, but the drinks selection was somewhat limited. No issues with the breakfast spread although service was a little slow owing to the crowd. Otherwise this hotel has an excellent location in downtown Singapore.",Dec-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Feb-20,5,Returning to this hotel whenever in Singapore,"We went here for vacation with the two of us. The room looked much better in real life than on the photos provided on the website or booking.com. We even returned here after a short visit to Thailand. Because of the covid19 virus visitors were screened for temperature, which is good. We were treated very well by all of the employees, especially Jill and Judy. They were all excellent. Jill even remembered how we liked our coffee in the morning and even helped me find local delicacies on the internet, so I could buy them as souvenirs and extended the check out time as my flight was in the evening. All in all, we had a wonderful experience and would not hesitate to come back again!",Feb-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Jan-20,5,Wonderful Staycation with Top Notch Service,"My wife and 2 years old girl stayed in the hotel in December 2019 for 2 nights. This is our second staycation in this hotel and we are much impressed with the service this time round.  The staff at crystal lounge (Judy and Jill) were very professional and friendly. We were having breakfast with an active toddler and they were very helpful to ease us into a quiet outdoor area so that we can have have breakfast without much disruption.  The room was well furbished and comfortable. Our room even had indoor steam room in the shower area which was very great for relaxation (esp busy parents when child is napping)!

Grand Park City Hall,Feb-20,5,Great Escape at the Grand Park,"We had a fantastic stay with the Grand Park. At the Club Lounge, we had the chance to meet Kripa, Judy and James who provided the best service. Thank you for making us feel at home.   Derek at the Tablescape was also an excellent restaurant manager and ensured we had a very good dinner. Unfortunately, their famous pork chop was sold out and we settled for the pork belly. Mushroom soup was superb.   Overall, we would definitely be back again for the top notch service. Thank you for rejuvenating us.  Bon/Yula",Feb-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,Fabulous stay at Grand Park City Hall,"Had the most amazing stay at Grand Park City Hall. The rooms had a boutique feel and the service was exceptional and very personalized. The rooms were well appointed although my view wasnâ€™t wonderful, everything else was extremely clean. The hotel is very high tech, which took a little time to adapt to. The food prepared by the Italian chef was delicious. Everyone went over and above the usual level of service. Special mentions have to be for chef Judy and Kripa in the Club Lounge, as well as Ganesan in the restaurant! They were but three, but ALL the staff were excellent which points to good management. Definitely worth a recommendation!",Mar-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,A great staycation,"Had a wonderful stay here, from the location which was truly convenient (especially if you are here as a tourist as it is near to majority of attractions and malls) all the way to the room which is very spacious and aesthetically pleasing. Check-in was truly a breeze thanks to Henny, she made it very seamless yet personalized. Henny even went the extra mile to show me how I am able to alter the light and aircon settings to my liking just from using my phone and other amazing things that could be achieved just from the phone itself. Not to miss out on other amazing staffs who made my stay even more welcoming and truly wonderful is Azman from concierge and Thomas from Tablescape. Thank you for the amazing stay and I am sure I will definitely visit again!",Mar-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Feb-20,4,Obsession with tech makes turning on a light a difficult task,"The hotel is good - very clean, friendly staff, great location, great value.   The room is nice but I have to say something about the tech obsession.  The lighting and aircon in the room are controlled by either a digital control panel on the wall or by an app on the phone.  The control panel is small, slow and difficult to use.  The phone app requires download and registration.  Imagine you'd need to get up in the middle of the night to go to toilet half asleep... You'd need to locate your phone, unlock it, find the app, go through the menu to turn on a light!  What's wrong with flipping a switch?  This is definitely not very friendly to people who are less tech savvy.",Feb-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Mar-20,5,2 night Stopover,I spent 2 nights here prior to the travel rules changing. I had a lovely room and liked being able to control the lights and heating via the phone app as well as the touch screen panel. The room was very clean and comfortable . Several members of staff were very helpful - Jill on reception on arrival and James in the breakfast restaurant went out of his way to give me some sightseeing tips. Narien was also helpful in advising on taxi on departure. The pool was lovely but unfortunately it was school holidays so not an area to relax as much as I  had hoped when booking a hotel with pool as there were quite a lot of noisy children - also the first morning at breakfast. The second morning was a more relaxed breakfast and a good choice and helpful staff. Just a minor point inâ€¦,Mar-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,4,Simple hotel,"Short staycation in the middle of the city. Easily accessible to sights, with nearby malls. Room view was of a multi-story carpark (with people able to see into our room) so we had to keep the curtains drawn at all times. Service was only average (room service was not keen to fulfil my request when I called from my room, but it was resolved when I went to make the same request at the front desk). Overall a good hotel. Might be able to get better tasting breakfast at the nearby mall... as the food is only average.",Dec-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,1,Not a good stay,"Pros: good location, easy to access and courteous staff. Cons: 1) Rooms were dirty even after changing rooms. Mould was on the ceiling, basin area had toothpaste stains, toilet area had stains, window ledge had stains, sofa had lizard poop.  2) Door had chain broken.  3) Breakfast service was severely understaffed and drinks were not served until service ended and only water was served, not the drinks ordered.",Dec-20,,

We had a nice view of the surrounding area, and enjoyed watching the sunrise in the mornings. The hotel is fabulous and in a great location. Everything is close by and the area is nice with many historic colonial era buildings, close to transport, and shopping centres.

Grand Park City Hall,Jan-20,3,Great rooms... unhelpful staff,"The hotel was modern and clean. However I was very annoyed that as a single traveller I couldnâ€™t get a room with a queen bed, I was given a room with two single beds. When I asked reception for a room with a queen bed they were very unhelpful and didnâ€™t seem like they wanted to help. So many hotels near by, next time Iâ€™ll stay somewhere else.",Jan-20,,
Grand Park City Hall,Dec-20,5,Great Staycation Location,"Love the room and location of the hotel. They have apps that allow you to prebook your check in time, breakfast time and swimming pool.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Mar-20,5,Simply Stunning,Hi just recently returned from a 10 night stay at The Swissotel Stamford. Singapore being on my bucket list. So carefully researched and done my homework in choosing this particular hotel. I know some people would say well a hotel is just somewhere to get your head down.

Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,Jan-20,5,Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed at The Stamford for three nights, with another couple on a post-cruise stop over. All the staff were very attentive from the moment we arrived. We were greeted by a lovely lady in the reception who checked us in and despite being early, managed to find two rooms that had been fully cleaned for both couples to check into straight away. This made a huge difference to our stay. The hotel is in a great location for seeing the sights of Singapore, quite a lot of which you can walk too but if you don't fancy walking in the heat, we found that the Taxi's were cheap (providing you get the right one's!) and a good way to get around.

Grand Park City Hall,Apr-20,5,Fantastic stay,"My wife and I stayed at Grand Park City Hall for 6 nights in January 2020 as part of our honeymoon. We absolutely loved it here and didn't want to leave. There was a bit of a mix up when checking in and we received a Deluxe Room instead of a Premier Room. When we advised the staff, they went above and beyond to rectify the issue. We received a complimentary bottle of wine and Crystal Club membership for the duration of our stay, which allowed us access to the Crystal Club lounge on Level 9. We had a buffet breakfast every day and enjoyed Judy's delicious personalised omelettes. We were also able to enjoy complimentary food and drinks in the lounge from 6pm-8pm each night.

We had the pleasure of receiving great service during our time from James, Jesmond (who makes a great Singapore Sling), Narein and Judy (who makes a great omelette and berry smoothie and will cook your breakfast to your requirements).

Notably in the club were - Thomas, Kripa and James The food quality in both club and restaurant were of a high standard. The pool was very well setup , except for shade, there is a definite need for a portion of this area to have some high density shade sails or similar.

I had an issue with my bank card at the front desk and they didnâ€™t pester me to get it resolved, I was given the keys to my room and told to come back down at my convenience.

Hotel shifted the 'lounge' to a small exposed area on level 3 that basically offers u nothing. The only major difference between the usual rooms and 'club rooms' is just an afternoon tea or cocktail set and thats it, which u r actually paying for in the price difference. With the difference u can easily have a good meal or drinks in a much nicer setting elsewhere.  The hotel management needs to understand that the club rooms is really more of an experience. The best service that we have received is so often from the staff at the club lounges. We booked club rooms for quiet moments where we can enjoy some drinks and also interact with the lounge staff.

Location is central, if you fancy a bit longer walk you can do both Little India and China town, my wife did both in the mornings before it got too hot. Room is spacious and modern with everything you'd need + tea/coffee/other freebies.  Due to an illness in the family we used just 2 of the 3 nights we had booked. Our rate was non-refundable but we were given a decent food/ drinks voucher that we were happy to spend at the bar- bar food was simple but abundant and tasty and the service was warn.

Barely half of what we ordered made it to our table - even the drinks were missing. We sat there for 45min wondering if they were still preparing the rest of our food and when we tried to call a staff to check, Mohamad saw us and simply waved us off TWICE saying that someone else will attend to us.

One Farrer Hotel,Dec-20,2,Devil is in the details,"Hotel Experience: 1) Hotel room was spacious and great location 2) However the 2 walking tours and ""masterclass"" itinerary was not transparently shared and had to follow up with hotel to share. 3) Masterclass was more of a food demo, no hands on experience. So I think need hotel to relook at the description. Moreover, the session started 45 min late having to wait for the media to finish their walking trail. I feel that the experience really marred for us as paying guests. Even though the Asst Manager knew about our displeasure and room number, there wasn't any service recovery or official apology. Just shows how keen they were in our feedback. 4) I left my new Decleor facial wash in the room and wrote to the hotel but they haven't gotten back. When they did get back (2 daysâ€¦",Dec-20,,

One Farrer Hotel,Apr-20,5,Great rooms and amazing outdoor pool,"I'm going to start with the negative which was the breakfast service in the restaurant on ground floor. It was not a one off bad experience, it was consistently badly organised and inefficient over 3 visits. No complaints about the variety of food on offer but when you have to ask for coffee time and time again until you actually get it, something is very wrong.  Apart from this bad experience, everything else was great. I had a skyline studio room for 4 nights on the 18th floor and it was enormous. If you're a swimmer like me then you should book this hotel on the strength of the massive outdoor 50m pool which is fantastic and was never busy.  Main restaurant aside, staff are very friendly and helpful. I'd certainly return here.",Jan-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Jan-20,4,Good Hotel,"Concierge and Reception staff very helpful and friendly, always with a smile, professionals. The Restaurant have to improve on bringing the food for everyone on the table at the same time, and picking it up when finish a bit quicker. We had to wait all the time. Pool Bar on 6th floor was nice, the pool great and the guy serving the drinks was really good.

One Farrer Hotel,Sep-20,5,Pleasant Second Visit,"Second stay at this hotel and naturally, we were a little apprehensive about the Covid 19 measures. Thankfully, it was not as bad as expected (no long queues at the Skyline lounge/gym). There were definitely some changes such as lesser food selection, closing of Skyline check-in counter and gym but it is nothing too major as there is still the main check-in and gym on the lower floors. However, one suggestion is that such changes (e.g. due to Covid 19) could be stated more explicitly on the website so that guests will be more informed. Nevertheless, what led to our second visit is the excellent service by the staff at Skyline lounge I.e. Malek, Guna, Joni and Fadhil. Special mention goes to Malek for always being so sweet and attentive to our needs. We were previously served byâ€¦",Sep-20,,

We had booked a shared room for three adults, one (me) sleeping on a sofa bed!  The receptionist straight away placed us in a suite, so I had my own room! Fantastic!!! The hotel is decorated in a modern style but could have lived in this two bedroom suite on level 15.  Breakfast was vast with so many choices that really you have to limit yourself!!  On the 6th floor We didnâ€™t use the gym or the spa but saw them ðŸ‘€! And the gym had modern equipment. This floor also had the swimming pool which because of the heat and humidity is a welcome cooling retreat.

We reached out to the hotel, and they offered to honor Agoda's price directly, along with a free upgrade. Brian was very helpful and prompt in responding, he offered early check in at 10am, so that we could enjoy the executive breakfast at the skyline lounge.   Malek & Joni were the main lounge team that assisted us throughout. Malek in particular remembered our preferences in beverages and kept my preferred food items past breakfast to complement my lunch.. Talk about above and beyond!  Unfortunately, there was some minor renovations at the hospital wing, which woke us up on the weekend... But the staff were very apologetic andâ€¦",Jul-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Sep-20,5,Pleasant stay for 1 night,"Although we had to walk a distance to the hotel from the drop off point, it was a very short walk and we reached within minutes. Proximity of hotel is near to amenities and we are able to navigate around easily. Enjoyed our visit to the level 6 pool with burgers ordered and resting within the area. Breakfast was served by ordering and customer service is well received. This will be our place to visit if there is a staycation to be booked again!   Thank you :)",Sep-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Feb-20,5,Family rooms,"We stayed in a family room for a couple of nights. The rooms are huge with a super king and an additional double which was in an alcove separated from the main room by the bathroom. There was a huge selection at breakfast and there are lots of restaurants close by for dinner, including at the mall which is only a few minutes walk away. It's a great base for exploring the city, particularly with the MRT being right underneath the hotel.",Apr-19,,
One Farrer Hotel,Jul-20,5,Amazing Hotel & Fantastic Staff,"I've been meaning to write this review for a long time but kept forgetting. Stayed here for 3 nights in March on the way back from Australia. Stayed in a Club Level room with access to the club lounge and we were blown away!  We were met at check in by Patrick, and the welcome we received, made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. It was quiet, and just before lock down so Singapore was very quiet. Patrick took time to explain the facilities at the hotel, arranged for our bags to be taken to the room, and explained what was around locally. Every time we saw him at reception throughout our stay, he asked us how our stay was, and was so genuinely interested and attentive.  The Club level room was beautiful.

One Farrer Hotel,Oct-20,5,Staycation after solemnization,"The catering & event manager (Celine Chan) that we engaged is very helpful and supportive throughout the whole event. 10Oct is a popular weekend so she kindly assisted us with the room booking (Skyline Studio). The room is huge and clean. View is also spectacular at night. The bed is comfortable that make us sleep right after the event. The location makes food delivery challenging as we are spoilt with too many choices.  In the morning, we enjoy the breakfast at the skyline lounge. Ambience and service is good. There are many choices for breakfast, tea, etc. There is also a big swimming pool.  We looking forward to returning for another staycation.  Thank you Celine & staff of one farrer hotel!",Oct-20,,

First of all, the room is big, beautiful, amenities are fantastic (loofah, masks, sanitizer etc). The tub is wonderful and the water is the hot! Just how I like it.   But what made my stay so memorable were these 3 fantastic staff at One Farrer. Harmony at the front desk, who was warm, proactive, and very patiently helped to arrange a last- minute booking for my bestfriend at 9pm on the day itself! I had such a good time here that I had to get a friend over.

However, despite the crowd, the service standards from the staff at One Farrer Hotel remains excellent. We booked a Skyline Studio Room and was upgraded to the Skyline Suite for our anniversary celebration. We would like to thank the staff of the Skyline Lounge for their excellent service and attentiveness to details despite the weekend crowd, especially Mr. Malek who is very professional and provided excellent service to all the guests at the Skyline Lounge.

Not only was the service staff very helpful and hospitable, the room (Skyline Studio) was amazing. The view was great, especially at night and we loved the club lounge. The club lounge has a great ambience and the service staff were very professional. The food served there was great especially the sweet and savoury (desserts). The evening cocktail was great too with a nice view by the window while eating. If you are still hungry after the meals served by the lounge, you can try the congee at socieaty or drop by sweechoon/scissors cut curry rice/CitysquareMall.

One Farrer Hotel,Oct-20,5,Excellent Swimming Pool. Staffs were welcoming,We just stayed 2 nights over the weekend at One Farrer Hotel and was happy that we were given an upgrade to the Skyline Room at level 18 as the room type that I booked was not available during check-in.   One Farrer Hotel had a very great location next to the MRT station and shopping mall. There are heaps of eateries and cafes nearby.   Our room was huge and it commanded a fantastic view of the city. Hotel was very quiet during my stay in October 2020 with few guests around. Our twin room was comfortable with the usual room amenities.   The swimming pool at level 6 was huge and clean and this would be one of the main reasons if I'm back again one day. Staffs at Garden Pavilion were very attentive during breakfast hours.    Thanks for the nice stay experience.,Oct-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Jan-20,5,Impeccable service,"My husband and I stayed here for three days on our way to Sydney. We received an exceptionally warm welcome and we were so grateful to have an early check in.  The Skyline room was good. Not amazing but good. The view was really cool, and the blackout blinds very black! We found the bed to be incredibly comfortable and the linen of high quality. The towels and the robes are too small.  The bathroom was lovely - we really appreciated the waterfall shower and the selection of toiletries. However, the strange and noisy clunky toilet door was a bit odd. And the hinge doesnâ€™t reach the wall so there was a lack of privacy. Alongside this, the lock was very difficult to use.   The air con was quiet & efficient - a godsend in the Singapore heat. The wifi was ok.   The real reason toâ€¦",Jan-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Apr-20,5,Fantastic room and superlative service,"With travelling restriction applied, the only way to have a short breakaway was to do a staycation in Singapore. Spending a night at Skyline studio room was a decision that we never regretted. The room was spacious and the view was marvellous.  We were first welcomed by staff Tommy who did a detailed introduction in explaining to us of the facilities that is within the hotel. His choice of words and his tone made us feel extremely welcome to the hotel.   Apart from the rapid process of checking in, another memorable experience was dining at the Skyline Lounge. Most of the time, we were served by staff Malek who greeted us by our name. I have to compliment him for his superlative service.

Our 1st half is served by MIRZA, he is very friendly, helpful and caring and very patient. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜Š He helped us take many good photo shots too. Thank you, Mirza!  Our 2nd half is served by another Lady (my bad, I didnâ€™t manage to get her name). She really is equally caring too. Keep filling up our warm water and look after with our needs. We just keep taking photos and she helped with few photos too. There are some random crew supervisor asking us how was the food, etc. In overall, their service is really tip-TOP and we are very well look after. It is rather quiet with not much guest, probably due to COVID season & the time we went there, but definitely a cozy feel & ambience.â€¦",Aug-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Nov-20,3,A disappointed birthday celebration,"We have visited Escape a number of times and we simply love the buffet spread and the staff service. We have always wanted to do a Staycation here but have never had a chance. And when we finally have it, it was rather disappointing for us.  We decided to book the Staycation here as my hubby and his good buddy have birthdays in Nov, thus we thought of having a celebration together. We make the reservations separately. When we called and requested for complimentary upgrade, they told us we can try during check-in day but maybe subjected to availability. My friends were told that there was a top up of $50 for the upgrade. Upon check-in, we asked the staff for complimentary upgrade but was told that it was available at $110.

Benjamin and in particular Malek made us feel very welcome and mixed pretty good drinks in the evening :)  Service at the main pool (Sunset Bar) is good and prices are on given this is a upscale hotel.  Room service fast and attentive; minor issue in room with TV was resolved fast!  We can very much recommend this hotel and I am pretty sure weâ€˜ll return for a staycation.",Nov-20,,

The lounge really made a difference, with complimentary good food served throughout the day in a nice and calm environment. Free drinks between 5.30-8.00 pm was a bonus. Great service by the lounge staff (especially Malek) too!   The rooms were reasonably spacious, clean and well-maintained. Nice big bed too.  The pool area was really good, with a huge pool and a sufficient amount of sun beds. The gym on floor 6 (open for all hotel guests) was reasonably well-equipped. The Skyline gym only had a few cardio machines.

One Farrer Hotel,Feb-20,5,Comfortable stay,"It is a beautiful property and people there are extremely friendly. They will go out of there way to make you feel welcomed here.  The pool, food, jacuzzi etc., everything was very thoughtful and relaxing.   A lot of people have already mentioned Malek and yes he deserves it thoroughly. He has the ability of taking you on a virtual tour of Singapore and will let you know about each and every detail of tourist spots.   Joni Ng also deserves a special mention as she used to save us a bento box of vegetarian food which was a delight. She would take the pain of explaining each and every food to us so that we didnâ€™t eat any non-veg item unknowingly. There was one more person who served us in the skyline lounge but I forget his name.   A bit of a disappointment was Chandra at theâ€¦",Feb-20,,

One Farrer Hotel,Dec-20,5,Wonderful staycation at One Farrer,We had a wonderful staycation at One Farrer from 15th to 16th Dec.  The main highlight of this stay was the warm hospitality shown by the staff from the reception to the Skyline lounge.    Kudos especially to Malek and Guna from Skyline lounge for their excellent service.  They were very welcoming and thoughtful to explain the meals in detail.  They were very attentive and anticipated our needs. They noticed that we needed tissue paper and provide serviettes promptly without request. They provided much helpful advice on the best timing to use the lounge to avoid crowds.    The meals at Skyline lounge were simple but very delicious.  The room is clean and well maintained. Seems to have been newly renovated.   We felt safe as all the facilities required safe entry check in.,Dec-20,,

One Farrer Hotel,Jul-20,5,Truly a pleasure - totally recommended!,"Probably my 5th time here and I'm still super impressed with the service at this restaurant. Usually come for the buffet but this time, it's just ala-carte only due to the pandemic. Fantastic service by the staff, with special mention to 'Affandi', in fact, the entire team on duty. A truly first-class service! Even my pot of TWG English Breakfast tasted fabulous, served with sugar cube in silver bowl and most importantly, hot milk even without having to request for it. Food was also delicious -  great culinary effort. Cutlery was packed in 'tamper free sealed' package. Kudos to this place, who despite the current situation, pays detailed attention to provide top quality service. Truly enjoyed my dining experience, the ambience, the soothing music... Thank you!",Jul-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Feb-20,1,Would Not recommend this to anyone,"I would recommend it to nobody. Most of the staff is cold. Customer satisfaction I believe is the last thing on their mind. 1. Water wonâ€™t be served to you at your table during breakfast buffet. You will be told itâ€™s kept on the table over there and to take it from there and there only. 2. Breakfast buffet is available till 10.30 AM and this is taken so seriously that even if you are not done eating by then at their overpriced restaurant, you will see waiters wiping your table in your face.  3. The escape restaurant which is just beside the reception will not serve you water if you walk-in anything during the day. Why? Because that water is only for restaurant use. You must go to the reception for that. Also water won't be provided after you checkout. How pathetic are theseâ€¦",May-19,,
One Farrer Hotel,Jul-20,5,A satisfying meal for the soul.,"I was greeted by the restaurant staff who were courteous and on smiles (despite them being on mask). After being ushered to my seat, they were attentive to my needs (especially with a 6 months old infant) and even directed my wife to a conducive place for breastfeeding.  In addition, I was also impressed with how the restaurant managed their hygiene in light of the current COVID situation. I feel safe during the whole dinning experience. I had the flower crab bisque, topside steak (medium rare) and cheng teng. Being a steak lover, I must impress upon the chef's culinary skill to perfect a medium rare steak. Even so for the flower crab bisque, the flavour is well balanced and appealing not only to the taste buds but also for the aesthetic appearance of the dish. My wife had theirâ€¦",Jul-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Jan-20,5,Fantastic Hotel,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIP's.  Fantastic service, friendly staff, spacious rooms, everything was perfect.    The hotel is a short 2 station ride 5 mins ride to Dhoby Gaut, or browse around Little India / Mustafa market across the road and the large City Mall is also across the road.  We stayed on the upper floor in a superior room with access to our own pool and lounge.  In fact, I would really recommend this - the staff in the lounge were so nice and you basically have access to all the food/drinks you desire.  The rooms were large, whisper quiet and with a friendly note from the manager really made you feel super welcome.  In summary, in terms of service and facilities, I really cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Thanks for a brilliant stay.",Jan-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Mar-20,5,Great hotel,"We have stayed at One Farrer Hotel twice and would go back again. Itâ€™s about 20 minutes by Taxi. The rooms are large with a decent size bathroom. The breakfast is plentiful with lots of options and room service and pool bar is also excellent. What I really appreciated is that on our second stay they allowed us to check in very early at no extra cost as we wanted to self isolate due to the caronavirus that was becoming a pandemic. Staff were all wonderful. The pool is large enough to have quite a few people in it, so itâ€™s a great place to stay for a few days where you can relax by the pool and have a few cocktails.",Mar-20,,

Itâ€™s a fairly new hotel and they have a huge pillarless ballroom with chandeliers which satisfied our requirements! They have 2 huge screens for couples to showcase their wedding photos which looked really grand. This is one special feature that they have and other hotels do not offer. Food portion is generous and we received many compliments that it is delicious as well. They offer both food portioning / lazy Susan requests for all tables. Bridal suite is very spacious and brightly lit. The private lounge which offers 4 meals a day is a nice touch to the entire experience! It made us feel really exclusive.

One Farrer Hotel,Feb-20,5,Urban Den Room is easily for 3 people #Triple Sharing,"Firstly: I dont know why nobody mentions this but Urban Den room is amazing for 3 people. Singapore hotels are expensive when you take triple sharing rooms in other 4 stars hotels like Ramada, Novotel, Hilton Garden Inn so one better opt for these kind of rooms which come for 6ft by 5ft extra bed & TV. This is what wins for me as I was with family.  Location: Outstanding. One is near to the MRT, near to all India eating joints, cabs are easily available, less Indian population in comparison to some of the nearby hotels (even though I am an Indian :P), and it is right in the centre of the city with all major attractions nearby.

The view from the hotel room on 12th floor was a fantastic cityscape - night view being the best. Had ordered food from their restaurant and I liked all of it, be it breakfast or some special lunch-dinner dishes. The mini-bar used to be replenished everyday and we never had to call housekeeping for anything. I always like it when the hotel staff takes good care of the guests making sure that each and every minute detail has been taken care of.  Contrary to my perception, the Urban den room was spacious enough and could easily accommodate 3 persons (one king bed and one separate bed for 3rd person in the foyer).

The florist team is very experienced and provide good recommendations to address couple's request.   My guests have good review for the food as well. The food at One Farrer is presentable and individually portion to cope with Covid restrictions. Some hotel charged extra to portion the food individually because of additional manpower required; but One Farrer offer this at no additional cost.

I would strongly recommend booking this room type as youâ€™ll get good view from the room due to the high floor. The room is clean and looks new. TV has many channels to choose from.    Another reason to book this room will be the lounge and pool that you can use on the 18th floor. 5 meals are provided in the lounge and you can also use the quieter infinity pool. Malek provides great service at the lounge.   City square mall is within walking distance so finding f&b, shopping, supermart and cinema is not a problem.

Rooms are a bit small but comfortable do opt for their Upgrade which included Lounge access.,Jan-20,,
One Farrer Hotel,Sep-20,1,Service quality dependent on who is on duty,"When I celebrated my bday here in Aug, service was impeccable. We got a surprise birthday cake. Our requests for more bath towels was done prior to our checkin. Everything was smooth and professional. Housekeeping was professional and respectful.  We decided to come back again one month later for a casual staycay, HOWEVER this staycay has been a nightmare. As a frequent hotel stayer, locally or overseas, I have to say OFH has an inconsistent service quality because this time round, service was lacking.  Firstly,  on the first night, we came back to the hotel late and had to shower late. Unfortunately, the water from the bathroom somehow flowed outside of the showering area and to the sink area. The bathroom mat was really wet and we called for the operator to send a housekeepingâ€¦",Sep-20,,

Goodwood Park Hotel,Dec-20,1,Bad Experience at Goodwood,My worst experience of all my staycations. Given it as 5* hotel but not the services... its really a bad experience for me. Not even a smile just standard script during check in. The DM when talking to me on the phone was more like a warden then the host. No empathy at all.

Thankfully, I was formerly a hotelier myself, and decided to DIY all the room decorations for my proposal to my then girlfriend (current fiancee). Quite understandable given the current pandemic situation. They were definitely very accommodating in my request for an early check-in as well as to view the room 2 days before my arrival.

As with the first hotel staycation, the pandemic phase I/II  restrictions adds a negative damperner to an otherwise happy stay.  However, I choose to review Goodwood Park Hotel at Scotts Road because it is a ""5-star Heritage"" hotel with one negative staff attitude.  I had a room reservation for 1-night but at the reservation counter, I decided to add on an additional night.  We had a ""Deluxe Poolside Room"" that had a small patio next to the Balinese-inspired Mayfair Pool.  The whole pool area is badly in need of re-vitalizing.

We were attracted by the good rate offered for locals and we were curious about the duplex and in-room dinning experience.  So, eagerly we booked and I did not know what to anticipate because I did not know where the duplexes were located.  We checked in on a Friday afternoon - slightly after 2 pm.  Prior to checking in, Ms Crystal Soh, the affable Assistant Reservations Manager, communicated with me thrice.  I made a mistake in the number of pax and she wanted to confirm the menu that we would like to have for the in-room experience as the Chef would need to prepare the ingredients.

So here goes.  To be honest, they were all pretty polite and sweet from beginning to end so not shaming the entire staff in general, but the buggy driver/guy who handled our luggage completely ignored my presence and made me feel disregarded.

The food spread was very delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   The staff were very accommodating and kind. They made us feel very welcomed and also made our young child feel important! They spoke very kindly to him and engaged him in conversation.  Our room was at the Mayfair Wing, overlooking the second (Balinese styled) pool. We had to book a slot for the main pool which was no trouble at all. Our room was clean and very comfortable.â€¦",Dec-20,,

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Nov-20,5,Excellent room and excellent service!,"Booked the Collyer Suite for my husbandâ€™s birthday. Upon booking I requested for an extra pillow and blanket for my 12yo son to sleep on the spacious sofa. That Saturday, they were incredibly busy but the staff had really good crowd control and informing us of our â€œqueue numberâ€. During check in, the receptionist told me to call if the blanket and pillows arenâ€™t in the room. Got in the room and the items werenâ€™t there so I gave 2 calls but were unanswered. My husband reached a few minutes later and I went to the lobby to register him in and told the receptionist about the items. She apologised as they were running full house and will walkie the housekeeping. As we were waiting for the lift, a male staff approached us to ask if we need assistance. We told him we are fine as someone has already attended to us but he said he will help anyway. After which, he said heâ€™ll liaise with his colleagues to ensure we receive it ASAP. We werenâ€™t rushing for the blanket and pillows anyway. In the room, we received 3 calls about 15-20mins apart to check if we received the items from housekeeping.  We also ordered food deliveries and thought we had to pick it up at the lobby but the porter sent it up promptly(we were at level 3). The service of this hotel was super! The room was fantastic and spacious especially the bathroom too!   We went to the pool at 8.40am the next day and there was nobody. We were told only 5 people can be in the pool (due to COVID-19) and we can utilise for an hour. At about 9.15am, there were many families waiting in line to use the pool.   I hoped that we could have a higher floor as the view of the city would have been nice. We had the view of the street. However, it could be because of the room type we booked. We wished we had another night or two to spend there. Maybe during the school holidays we would hope to come back. â€¦",Nov-20,Travelled with family,
Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Nov-20,5,Excellent Stay with Ascott as a solo Traveller.,"1. The check in/out process was swift. 2. Sufficient privacy and feel safe as there was no crowding in the lobby. 3. Staffs were friendly with just the right amount of privacy given to guest. 4. Upon entering the suite, room feels well ventilated, temperature to aircon was set well, has a very feel good, cleanliness to it. 5. Facilities are awesome, pool not crowded, outdoor lounges and living room space, for guest that does not want to swim to have a space to chill. 6. Selection of bathroom shower gels / lotion / sanitiser / moisturiser, is amazing, as well as the numbers of hangers provided. Can feel that Ascott is sensitive to guest's needs. 7. Absolutely love the storages too, hidden shoe rack in cabinet, sufficient hangers, towels and all, that makes it very comfortable to keep things tidy instead of scattering in within the rest area. 8. Lighting are perfect, with ambient lighting and reading lights, and ample outdoor lighting through sheer curtain. 9. Different spots to lounge within the room, bed, ottoman with coffee table, a proper desk with chair, vanity space. 10. Provide great communal space options to host guest's visitors for a short period too. 11. Well located and great views, to rejuvenate the soul.â€¦",Nov-20,,
Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Feb-20,2,Better suited for Air B&B.,"Upon arrival we were informed that there would be no bar, no restaurant, and no room service past 2pm for the entirety of our 3 day stay. Had we known this in advance we would have booked at another property all together as they advertise all this as full service on booking websites. Furthermore they didnt even offer advice on an easy alternative in the neighborhood almost to the point of resisting (just saying they didnt know over and over). So at the end of the day we had to walk for 30 minutes round trip for every bottle of water or snack, not really fun on vacation.  The rooms were spacious and clean but that is about the extent of positive feedback I can offer.  The staff was unfriendly and short for the most part like they were irritated with Guests inquiring of any information. Housekeeping was VERY loud every morning starting at 6am with door slamming, laughing, carrying on and yelling.  Don't bother with the do not disturb sign, they will ring your doorbell multiple times and call your room anyway. And whatever you do if you are (un)fortunate enough to stay here do not, I repeat DO NOT use the washer/dryer! It fried about $1,000 worth or our clothes beyond recognition.   I wish I had more good things to say about this property but it was unfortunately quite disappointing and hung a cloud over our Singapore visit. That being said, expedia did give us a nice credit to make up for the property's extensive false advertisement which we used in Indonesia where they know the meaning of hospitality.  My next reviews immediately following this will be definite 5 stars at our hotels in Bali.â€¦",Feb-20,Travelled as a couple,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,"Not just a stay, it's an experience of a lifetime","Had a really amazing 3D2N staycation here. Everything was impeccable and perfect. It was so comfortable to just chill and relax in the room all day. The room also included a 'care kit' that has face masks, wet tissue and hand sanitizers, it was really thoughtful. The bed is very plush and comfortable I slept really well. I also love the bathroom that's fully clad in marble and a huge bathtub with book reading stand - there is even a bathtub cushion for ultimate comfort. I love the breakfast, my favourite has got to be the fish porridge, i had it 2 days in a row! There's just something about its simplicity yet so tasty. Also recommend the nasi lemak as it's so fragrant and Raffles speciality omelette that has masala powder in it -super unique and yummy! I am really glad to book a staycation here as it is a really memorable one.â€¦",Sep-20,,
Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Dec-20,5,Truly a memorable experience,"I booked the Finlayson Suite with the purpose of proposing to my then-girlfriend (now fiancee). The suite was immaculate and had all the amenities I was looking for, all of which were in pristine condition and were well maintained.   Cooking in the suite was a breeze thanks to all the provided kitchen utensils and crockery.   The ambience of the room, if you are looking for that, is romantic and luxurious, with hints of tasteful, modern flairs; a nice contrast against the older facade the building is known for.   If there is anything to highlight in particular, it has to be the level of quality of housekeeping and cleanliness. The staff were very efficient and thorough, ensuring the stay was cozy and sanitary. A simple call to the front desk is all it took to rectify a minor issue of the sink not draining properly, with the service staff coming to fix the issue almost instantly.   Their other facilities are maintained and cared for to a high standard, and you are bound to be wowed by the view from the pool. It is popular, so you do need to get in there at the right time.   If there was a complaint to be made, it may be the complimentary breakfast, which you can get as a takeaway order, On one of our orders, we were given multiple wrong items, which was a little upsetting, but certainly nothing much to cry foul over.  without a doubt, book this place for an enjoyable experience.â€¦",Dec-20,,
Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Sep-20,5,Excellent location. Spotless clean. Compact but modern service apartment.,"I stayed here for 1 week recently. I used to live in the condo (The Sail) across the street from this property so I know its convenient location. I picked this property instead of Grand Hyatt in Orchard  (they charge the same price at the time of booking) because it's in my old hood and I miss my morning run around Marina Bay. I was not disappointed. The property and my room was super clean. Hand sanitizers were everywhere in public areas. My service apartment studio was compact but well designed and modern, I got everything I needed for the week (wifi, study desk, nice bathroom, washer cum dryer, microwave, big fridge, and all essential kitchenwares), it's very convenient even  though I didn't have to cook. MRT entrance is just a stone away which makes easy commute. Rooftop swimming pool and terrace were open for guests which was a great plus. Most staff were very friendly and helpful. I just wish the front desk staff could be more attentive and show some warmth while serving guests. Overall it was a great stay. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone.â€¦",Sep-20,,

Every staff we met were eager to serve and ensure we are well taken care of from check-in to check-out.  The management lives up to the global commitment of clean promise and safe management as we could see the effort put in by the management to ensure guests and staffs are safe.  Dim sum at Yan Ting is scrumptious. Reservation in advance is highly recommended as the restaurant was busy on Wednesday afternoon.

The St. Regis Singapore,Jul-20,1,3 star experience in 5 star hotel.,"I have just finish my 2 nights at st regis singapore today. Which I would like to feedback on the level of service that my family and I had received.   1) Check in experience was pleasant and well handled by front desk and I was greeted as titanium member.  2) lobby staff was inattentive to guest, which when my family and I were walking around the premise, hotel staff just brush pass us without greeting or saying hi to us.  3) food order for in-room dining was unpleasant. When the wagyu burger I ordered was sent to me, it was warm and not hot. The meat patty was also overly cook which resulted my unable to consume the patty.  4) I had ordered delivery from external vendor and was told to self collect. The concierge male staff was handing the food over to me with a poor attitude of asking me to take it properly.  5) house keeping changed the towels with stains on the towel (took photographs)  6) French coffee press was not clean throughly before check in. There were bits of tea leaves left over on the container ( took photo).  7) amenities in the room were not maintained, clothes hanger were spoiled and the lampshades were with dust and stained.  8) Breakfast staff were inattentive, keep forgetting orders and drinks. When after reminding, still did not serve. We left the restaurant after meals. â€¦",Jul-20,Travelled with family,

I am a big fan of St Regis - great butler service, friendly staff, quiet/calm environment, luxury room/pillows etc. This is my 3rd visit within 2 years. Unfortunately, it was a really unpleasant stay this time round.   There was a crowd in the hotel. Check-in was smoother for us as we already checked-in online. Be prepared to wait if you have not done first. There are plenty of comfortable seats around though.   Butler service was not able to cope with such full capacity. Tea took up to 30min/45min to come. There was one mixed up. It took almost 1.5h - 3 calls before they got the order right (btw, it was just 1 English Breakfast & 1 Sencha).

I got upgraded to a corner room. Breakfast had good choices. I like the location of this hotel since it's a bit tucked away from the busy Orchard rd.

The St. Regis Singapore,Nov-20,5,Impeccable service from the 1st moment,"Planned a 3D2N staycation for my wife to celebrate her birthday.

What is 7-star service, well its not just filling our glasses andb removing old plates.  Its attentiveness, its having a conversation, if the patron feels like a conversation.  The staff were amazing in this regard, gjving plenty of time to chat with my elderly mother, complete patience and respect, but also interested to chat.  The food speaks for itself, its fine dining in a buffet.  Loved the champagne theatre in the lobby to start the evening.

At the front desk, Ms Sophie Lee attended to us and explained the facilities of the hotel. She was very professional and has a friendly demeanor.

Being a Marriott Bonvoy Gold member, I received a room upgrade to a big room on a high floor.  The room was luxuriously appointed and had a huge bathroom.  It reminded me of another of their group hotel - The Ritz Carlton in Tokyo which I had previously stayed.  That night we had dinner in the French restaurant Brasserie Les Saveurs.  It was a seafood buffet with live piano music but the buffet food choices were rather limited.  The next morning we had breakfast in the same place.

The St. Regis Singapore,Mar-20,5,Always a pleasure,"Stayed here numerous times  over the period of 2 months and always had an amazing stay. I especially loved the butler service who was always willing to go the extra mile. One time I accidentally broke my glasses and asked for a super glue, and the butler delivered. Breakfast was also a delight, they have an a la carte menu (with dishes like omelette with caviar) in addition to the buffer spread. Food orders came pretty fast as well which I really appreciated especially in the morning when things were a little hectic. The bar has a nice atmosphere in the evening. I also enjoyed the pool for downtime in the afternoon. With that said, I have encountered a room where the shower stall has a rather unpleasant smell. Room refurbishment is probably needed soon.

The St. Regis Singapore,Feb-20,1,Horrible bed - biggest letdown!,"We didnâ€™t expect that the gigantic king-sized bed in the St Regis Singapore was the biggest let down in our two nights stay cation which became a one night stay instead.  My husband developed a neck strain and a migraine that lasted throughout his birthday and I had very bad backache from the very lumpy and soft mattress.  If you need a mattress that is firm and gives back support, do not try this!  Once you lie on the mattress, you sink right in the middle of the mattress. Our guess is the mattress is probably old and needs to be changed for better backcare!  Never did I expect the bed mattress to be the biggest downer in our staycation. We immediately packed our bags and went home to our own mattress. And our backache and headache went away the next day!",Aug-19,,

The breakfast was extreme. I had caviar lobster omelette as breakfast. A pleasant surprise for such a menu in the morning. Pancakes / waffles were pretty awesome. And because you are a guest of the hotel, the Chinese fine dining restaurant (Yan Ting) will allow you in even without booking.

My elite status was promptly recognised upon checkin. We were given the Lady Astor room, a really beautiful room.  There is no special lounge for elite members at this property but we were invited for a special drink during the evening at the cool Astor bar. See the photo. Finger food thrown in. Sad thing is that drinks and food are single serving.  Back to the room, it's AMAZING! The bathtub faced the open area (rest assured nobody can see you). Room is huge and loveâ€¦",Dec-20,,

This weekend, we were having our place repainted, and needed a place to stay while the work was being done. We booked the Caroline Astor suite for a couple of days (same as our previous stay). The couch in the living area was quite unstable this time, and a couple of times it tipped over backwards when I sat onto it. The baths, as always, was delightful.  As it was a working weekend for us, we appreciated the coffee and tea that our butler sent to our rooms whenever we needed.

Room size was decent with a huge washroom and everything worked. Butler service was always with a smile and all the butlers were extremely courteous. Breakfast which was included was excellent although menu was limited. There's complimentary parking for in-house guests which helps else parking in that area would be very expensive. Special shout out to Ms Amy at the front desk who advised about expected congestion during breakfast times and for being super thoughtful for sending a complimentary birthday cake to my room after noticing that my birthday had just passed - totally unexpected but super appreciated. Definitely one of the best hotels in terms of service with a smile!",Sep-20,,

I might have the name wrong but at the entrance, Mr. Ali I think (an older gentleman taking temperature - 20th August at around 1pm) - he was AMAZING! He was kind enough to bring me to the reception and made sure I sat down. My heart was literally melting from his amazing gesture. And then the kind lady at the front desk (I believe it's Sophie/Sophia?) - very quick and easy check in, and she managed to explain everything that I need to know in that short brief time! The whole lobby is stunning to look at! The room was beyond my expectations. I could literally sleep in the bathroom because honestly it's one of the sexiest bathrooms ever. I love how they had masks and sanitisers and wet wipes in the room which is such an amazing touch! I need to come back asap!",Aug-20,,
The St. Regis Singapore,Feb-20,5,Memorable Stay at St Regis Singapore,"Recently I stayed at St Regis for a weekend staycation. St Regis proved to be the best hotel with its excellent service from the minute I stepped into the hotel till the end of my stayca. The staff at the reception to the butler providing you the service in the room were outstanding in making the guests welcomed and gave the feel at home. Every staff that you see around the hotel be it at the pool, spa or at the lobby were so warm and so forthcoming to serve you. The hotel breakfast is another area that needs an applause not because the food was excellent but because of the staff attending to your various needs, having conversation with you and always checking if you were alright.

The St. Regis Singapore,Oct-20,5,Fantastic overall experience,"We whiled away our weekend in this luxurious hotel. Unfortunately, we failed to secure any room upgrade as the hotel had high occupancy over the weekend. No matter, even the basic room felt like a mini suite. We totally enjoyed the room decor. The butler service was fantastic, and the coffee they brought to the room was absolutely delicious. During the stay, we ate at Brasserie for Afternoon Tea, Drawing Room for dinner and Brasserie again for breakfast. The breakfast was one of the best we had in terms of quality. One thing to note though, was the service. Even though the waiting staff were professional and courteous throughout, the waiting time can be improved.

The standard of food on offer was very high and presented beautiful y, the astounding and disappointing part of the day was the lack of knowledge from the staff!! Clearly there had been no training completed as no one knew anything about the wine on offer, let alone the food. Something you don't expect at this hotel!! We enjoyed our lunch, the place is well worth the visit, but the price you pay should cover well versed staff with a complete understanding of the wine and the menu.

This room also has the ability to interconnect adjacent rooms, which would be ideal for families or those who want to stay close together. If you did have interconnecting rooms, there is also a separate door from the main hallway that can be used as a private entry to your room's.

It was clearly written in the email from agoda that the room is for 3 people. We received email from the hotel confirming our staycation dates etc. However, when checking in at hotel we were told that the agoda price is for 2 people and we have to pay $100+ for the third person.

I had informed them in advance regarding the occasion for the stayacation, so they provided me a complimentary room upgrade , a birthday cake and balloons in the room prior to check in, which my daughter was delighted to see.  They also have a Buttler service with complementary tea/ coffee, which was very useful.

The St. Regis Singapore,Aug-20,5,Exquisite Hotel with Personalised Touch,"My wife and I have our first stay with St Regis at The St Regis Singapore recently. St Regis is a top-tier hotel brand. Many excellent points have been mentioned by other reviewers and I would highlight two small details which have also impressed us:  1. The provision of seats at check-in reception for the guests is an excellent touch. This small gesture will be appreciated by the guests who may be tired after a long flight. Not many hotels, even top tiered ones like Capella and Ritz Carlton Singapore, provide such kind thought. It would be icing on the cake if more seats can be provided for the waiting guests without diminishing the elegance of the lobby.   2. Personalised handwritten welcome note by GM addressed to the guest by name in the hotel room is another warm touch.â€¦",Jul-20,,

I have stayed in a range of their rooms and each one has been very beautifully furnished and the facilities are great. The location is quite convenient to the shops and taxis are always readily available if so. The food is great including the buffet breakfast with a good range of food. It is very open and airy and the aircon is a blessing in the heat. I have thoroughly enjoyed each stay here and would reccomend it for anyone; business, family or couples. It is on the pricier sides compared to other hotels but I think it is worth the stay.",Sep-19,,

Given the special occasion, we were especially grateful to these ladies for the upgrade. The balloons and birthday cake that greeted us when we returned to our room that evening told me I had made the right decision in spending the weekend here. Cocktails at the bar have been replaced with a drink of choice and antipasti served in the room.

The hotel has a nice gym and a small pool, which is not great for a full day of swimming but ok for a quick refreshing dip. Breakfast was amazing.

We enjoyed the covered balcony during the afternoon rains. The staff was generally excellent. The pool area is spacious and a great place to have lunch. Our only negative observations was that the staff in the Writer's bar did not seem to know how to serve champagne.

From the moment of stepping in, we knew it was going to be a very special stay. There is something very charming and magical about staying at Raffles, which has been wonderfully restored and injected with a dose of modern classiness that appealed very much to our modern sensibilities, and yet the old-world charm that it continues to exude triggers a curious yet tantalising feeling of being lost in time and space; a very much welcomed feeling of escapism indeed.

Staff just donâ€™t know what is going on. Here are a selection of issues:  Pre arrival, we picked dates based on restaurant open dates (given to us by staff).  2 weeks after committing, paying, reserving, and booking time off work the hotel came back saying that Dame De Pic was not open for lunch when we were there.  (these were dates that they gave us).

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,3,The Iconic Raffles that did not meet expectations.,"--Summary-- Our stay at Raffles would be something I would callâ€¦ a hit and miss scenario. There were indeed areas where the hotel met or exceeded my expectations but also areas where it was pure disappointment.   To keep it simple, Raffles Singapore clearly has one of the best hard products (Suites and Amenities) on offer in Singapore. The Suites are just superb and extraordinary. The restorations of Raffles that happen last year did the hotel well as it truly is a flagship hotel now. However, the soft products (Service and tangible touches) leaves much to be desired. Yes, there were some staff who took great care of us, but also there were some staff who did not bother either. This is a key point in my opinion as if the hotel brands itself based on Luxury and Service, it has toâ€¦",Sep-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,3,"Amazing Property, Inconsistent Service","Raffles hotel is pure luxury and the property is gorgeous. It has a perfect balance of modern amenities with the old colonial looks. Nothing can be fault in terms of the rooms, size, location, and decors.   I've stayed in raffles for 3 times on 3 different occasions. Twice in the month of July and once in August. Being so frequent to the property, the level of service provided was vastly different.   The first time I was there, everyone was ever so welcoming, friendly, and extremely attentive to your every need. The wow factor was there as being in their private tranquil courtyards takes you away from the bustling streets right next door. The soundproofing of the rooms are one of the best too!

The 3/5 (or if I could, 3.5/5) score I gave is reflection of the value I feel I am receiving for the price I paid and my happiness level when I checked out.  What I really liked about Raffles Singapore:  Â·       The hotel is iconic, luxurious and beautiful. The recent refurbishment was spot on, everything felt new and clean but much of the historic charm remained. My first stay here and I was very excited!  Â·       Breakfast was fantastic.

Pillows, bottled water and a chain of events due to grossly amateurish lapses blighting my stay have resulted in unavoidable embarrassing conclusions, whereby I disagree with this luxury hotel billing itself as an icon of Singapore.   Management needs to clearly delineate differences between housekeeping & ""butlers"", retrain some ""butlers"", or management needs change, because housekeeping provided me much better butler service than â€œbutlersâ€, thus horrifying this first-time guest at Raffles Hotel Singapore (the hotel name I shortened into RHS, for this review).

I just CANNOT fathom how it is possible to spend so much money and so much time in renovating a top-notch hotel and NO COMPETENT or smart guy has brought the idea that not hearing every step from neighboring rooms could be kind of a good idea.

Take your money to the refreshed Cappella or a suite at the Ritz if you're expecting a proper level of service.

Here are the facts of this 4 day 3 night birthday staycation:  Prior to stay - Prior to checking in on the day, I have had to call the hotel 4 times to try to reach the spa as I needed to 1) change a prior booking and 2) ask if we can use the facilities on another date during our stay.  3 times the phone rang out and the answering machine was full, soâ€¦",Dec-20,,

La Dame de Pic however, the new restaurant, can be given a pass. Had a stellar wine list, but the food was not bad per se, just ordinary. There was nothing special about it. I've lived and worked in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Washington and Singapore. Robuchon is much better. Visit the hotel, stay at the hotel, but give La Dame de Pic a miss.",Feb-20,,

These pink drinks were created to look like a fruity punch so that women could enjoy a drink or two, when women were not supposed to be drinking.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Wonderful accommodation and service,"We recently had an amazing stay at Raffles for five nights. Mum & I go away every January and this year she surprised me with the accommodation choice. Right from the greeting at the airport we felt welcome and incredibly well looked after. Even before we arrived, Reena made sure everything was going to be perfect for our stay via email. Our butlers Priscilla, Mako & Chloe were so helpful and lovely - nothing was too much trouble.   We felt completely spoilt and were so impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and grounds. Definitely wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying at Raffles - a very special treat!",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Do not leave Singapore without visiting !,"When we visited last year, we could only go to the Long Bar as the main hotel was still being refurbished. So we just had to go back and how pleased we were that we did. It is like stepping back into a bygone era with all the modern day comforts.  The service is as you would expect - first class.  We chose to have afternoon tea there. What a treat. When we could not possibly manage all the glorious food put in front of us, it was boxed up for us to take away. When we thanked the staff for their attention and kindness, their reaction was to thank us for coming. What a total delight !!",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Awesome Stay Again,"My return visit was as amazing as before. This time i had the Palm Court Suite which i feels very luxurious, so spacious and warm feeling. The limousine that pick up me up was nice and timely.   On arrival I was greeted by two tall handsome doorman and whisk straight away to my suite by two friendly reception staffs. Along the way met few familiar faces and it was a nice feel. (My last stay was pre curcuit breaker)  The service for the 3 days stay i had was superb. The breakfast was amazing too. Do try their signature omelet, to die for! Great service from Butler Gina and Chef Concierge Rosli. You are amazing!   Hopefully to be back in January. THANK YOU ALL!",Dec-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Amazing luxury experience,The refurbishment has taken Raffles to another level of luxury. Staff and service were beyond even our high expectations. The food was exceptional and the drinks in the long bar was an experience we will remember for ever.,Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Time for Afternoon Tea,"A beautiful experience.  From the entrance, to the staff and the food, everything about afternoon tea at the Raffles is special.   We chose to have afternoon tea with a glass of bubbly.  The variety of the food was fabulous.  There was a great tea selection to choose from.    We would highly recommend this as it was a great experience.",Aug-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,5,Excellent stay!! From start to finish - truly amazing,"My GF and I had a 2 night stay at Raffles last weekend (30th Oct - 1st Nov). From the word go, the service was impeccable. Small things that really went a long way. Big thanks to Chadi and his team who ensured we had an excellent stay.   We dined at the Tiffin Room, and it was argubely the best Indian food we have eaten. The afternoon tea was also very good!   Highest quality of service!!",Oct-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,"Stunning building, and a Singapore Sling!","Other than the Merlion, the other iconic place to visit is Raffles. Beautiful building and grounds, with a rich and colourful history. And what do you do when you get to Raffles, you have a Singapore Sling. Walk into the Long Bar, grab a seat and dive into the complimentary roasted peanuts in the shell. And don't forget to drop your shells on the floor as they did in the early days (kept the floor free from dust). Raffles is the birth place of the Singapore Sling, a beautiful cocktail, very refreshing and absolutely delicious. Not cheap, but when in Singapore it would be rude not to!",Oct-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,Magical,"Fulfilled a long held ambition to stay at Raffles.  It lived up to the hype and the history. The service is extraordinary... all the staff give the impression that YOU are the guest that they got up that morning to serve.  Smiling, professional, super discrete.  You feel like royalty.",Aug-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,5,"Well located, Good Food & Stay",Arrival-treated guests beyond my expectations. The state room which I stay extremely clean and unexpected complimentary I received on the table that once I entered my room . The hotel makes use of technology by providing ipad to use the tv where other hotels in spore which I have stayed have done so. I was extremely impressed with the amenities provided inside the room . I wish I could stay longer . It is really a memorable experience . Yes I may want to come back to stay in the hotel again,Nov-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Long Bar - long wait!,It might be a long wait but worth it. Singapore sling is a bit pricey and really not that tasty (my opinion) but the atmosphere and history is definitely worth it.  Shelling of peanuts and throwing on the floor is something everyone does & is encouraged. So if youâ€™re willing to wait - enjoy the peanuts ðŸ¥œ & drink !!,Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,4,Wonderful hotel staycation with service excellence,Wonderful time passed in this luxurious  hotel and everything was perfect  in all points Staff was amazing and very helpful. we felt like in honeymoon for the 3 days 2 night passed there.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,3,One detail which can ruined a wonderful experience,"To start with, and no mistake... This is a fantastic hotel and our experience could have been perfect unless one detail came to almost ruin entirely it: On Sunday morning, at 9:30am.. when you expect quietness and a smooth wake up in such an amazing place, you are suddenly wake up by a 85db machine used by the Gardener team trimming the bushes right under your room.. and not 3mn, but during more than an hour.. Management team, how can you schedule such heavy & noisy maintenance job on a Sunday early morning?? In luxury, it is all about details.. and that one was a very annoying mistake. Still a long way to go to reach the Top League Hotel in the world if you cannot understand this, and plan such noisy maintenance in a moment, Sunday morning, where your guest peace and quietnessâ€¦",Nov-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Timeless Experience,We have had the pleasure to stay in Raffles on a couple of occasions or go with friends for afternoon tea/drinks. This year due to restrictions we decided to go for Christmas staycation and were not disappointed. The stay was a quiet affair allowing us to switch off and relax and try to forget for a few days what was a terrible year for all. Looking forward to 2021 and our 30th Anniversary which we were already planning for Raffles having had a wonderful 25th Anniversary there it seems appropriate. the staff are awesome and the seamless process under these restricted conditions was great .. all part of the experience.,Dec-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Afternoon tea.,"You must try this ! It has just been totally renovated since the last time we visit. And itâ€™s absolutely stunning. We had promised ourselves an afternoon tea ,donâ€™t be put off , it was faultless ,and the wide choice that they present was awesome .

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Apr-20,5,Singapore Sling - Long Bar,"Wow - how I would love to stay here! We stayed in Singapore and visited for a sling! The sling was amazing - so amazing we had a few each. The bar staff were great and the atmosphere was perfect.  Although what made this so good was the doorman at the main reception. He was just so down to earth and friendly. To say that we were not guests and just visiting the Long Bar, he treat us like we were staying in their best suite. As we waited for our taxi to leave we chatted to him. He was just so down to earth and friendly. He told us a bit about himself etc.  The whole place is stunning and seeing how friendly this guy was has made us want to return, although the next time it will be to stay!   We are really excited to come back and stay with you Raffles, please thank this lovelyâ€¦",Mar-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,4,Fantastic but Expensive,After nearly two years of closure Raffles is back on the map. The whole building revamped into pristine  condition. When in Singapore it is a must to visit this place and see the splendour.  And of course sample the famous Singapore Sling. That been said the service was not as good as it should be. The wait for a menu and then the wait of over 20 minutes for a drink to be served were much too long and the staff did not seem busy. An expensive treat.,Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Exquisite Afternoon Tea!,"A once in a lifetime experience.. Raffles champagne afternoon tea was everything we had hoped it to be and more.. Followed by a meander around the gift shop and then a Singapore Sling in The Long Bar, we had the most memorable of experiences. For those people moaning that you couldnâ€™t get in because you had shorts on.. Treat Raffles with the respect it deserves and dress for the occasion! It really was fabulous. A harpist playing in the background whilst we ate the most decadent of afternoon teas, was something we will never forget. Thank you...",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Anniversary Trip,"Exceptional hotel with exceptional service and care.  The renovations are amazing and the rooms and amenities are superb.  We stayed in the Courtyard Suites that are sizable and very comfortable and with great charm.  We so enjoyed staying at this iconic hotel during our visit to Singapore, which did not disappoint.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,4,Raffles Hotel,"Forget about staying at Raffles unless you have really really deep pockets.  None the less, it is still worthwhile to pay a visit to this iconic grand dame.  The setting and courtyards will take your breath away.  While not all areas are open to the general public, it is still a pleasant surrounding to stroll and ,of course, you can still stop at the bar and have their expensive world renown Singapore Sling.",Nov-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Fantastic High Tea,"We had high tea for a birthday treat. We were looked after exceptionally well from start to finish, the staff were friendly and attentive. Food was excellent and teaâ€™s were lovely. One of the best afternoon teaâ€™s weâ€™ve ever done and felt really special. We went to Long Bar after and that felt more like a tourist trap but the afternoon tea experience was exquisite.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,Unforgettable Stay,"Having lived in Singpore for 15 years we took advantage of a staycation at Raffles whilst not being able to travel.  We went with high expectations, and every one of them was met.  The service and ambience are everything you would expect. What sets this hotel apart is the incredible architecture and long and interesting history.  A big thanks to everyone who made our stay very special â™¥ï¸.",Sep-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,"Superb service, luxury and charm","Outstanding experience.  The service, luxury and old world charm combined with subtle modern technology was charming.  The facilities available are world class and we were often tempted to spend more time in the hotel than would usually be the case.",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,4,Not quite a 5,"We stayed here , for 3 nights, and , whether it was because it had recently been reopened , but the service in some areas, was to be questioned, waiters forgetting drinks orders, pool attendants a bit vacant when asking for things, but apart from a  few very small things theres no doubting this is a classic place. Rooms are beautiful, modern comfy and luxurious.Highly expensive but once in a lifetime stay.",Oct-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,4,Fun visiting the famous Hotel,Itâ€™s worth a visit to walk through The Raffles Hotel. Of course we wanted to try the original Singapore Sling. There was a line up to get into the bar on Sunday so we went back the next day at 3 pm and got in right away. They also serve at the pool bar if you want to avoid lines. Heads up- the Sling is $33 US with free peanuts. Still a fun visit.,Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,one of the world's iconic hotels,"This is one of the iconic hotels of the world and a full renovation was completed in 2019. Tried to book many months in advance and was told the hotel was fully booked during the period between Xmas and New Year I was in SG with my daughter. Not to worry, we visited anyway and strolled through the ground floor arcades. The renovation has clearly been done meticulously. I cannot judge on the service - hopefully there will be another opportunity to stay at the hotel.",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Oct-20,5,"Legendary Singapore hotel, immaculately restored","Spent a one-night staycation here last week having waited patiently for it to re-open after a total refurbishment a couple of years back.  The hotel is magnificent, the restoration has been done so as to retain the storied history of La Grande Dame but also bringing it up to to date.  Each room is a suite and ours had a standalone rolltop bath which was wonderful.  Room was massive, four-poster bed extremely comfortable, staff were discrete and of the highest order.  Could not fault anything, a wonderful experience and we cannot wait to go back",Oct-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,The truly magnificent Grand Dame is back,"After being closed for over a year the one and only Raffles Hotel is back. It is just the most iconic place to stay in Singapore. It's just magical, it has been beautifully restored the attention to detail just amazing. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful at the same time utterly professional. I do have a criticism, The Court Yard Bar for me doesn't work it's now enclosed with hight bushes that make it feel quite claustrophobic. Before it was open plan and much better. (Please change it back to how it was !!)  See you again in November.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Atmosphere retained!,"We were worried that the refurbishment would have taken away some of the character and atmosphere we have always enjoyed, and what has drawn us back again and again. Thankfully, Raffles is every bit as good as it ever was, but with the added bonus of more up to date in room entertainment systems. Whether it's the pool, the gym or the restaurants, everything has simply been brought slightly more up to date.  As always, the staff were friendly, polite and helpful, regardless of whether we had met them before. If you want to spoil yourself Raffles is still the best place to do it.  It never fails to feel special, and Christmas at Raffles is definitely the only way go. We can't wait to go back in September.",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,La Dame de Pic restaurant,"My wife and I went to eat at La Dame de Pic and we were very happy to be able to discover this magnificent restaurant.  The food was excellent but for a such restaurant the details are very important.  The bread was cold and a little hard as if it were made the day before (hope not).  the other important point is the arrangement of the dishes and from the cutlery, the cutlery was always badly placed and we always had to center the dish in front of us. Otherwise very friendly staff.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jul-20,5,Heritage Tea,"The heritage tea experience is exquisite. The service is impeccable, with staff like Marg, Emelyn, Vivian, Marvin, Martin, Dian and Raymond being professional and friendly.   The establishment should consider noise enforcement though, for rowdy guests who banter too loudly or who use their devices sparingly.  Dr.Maverick Yeo Accor Platinum member",Jul-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,Perfect staycation,"We had two nights at Raffles as part of a 2 for 1 staycation package and really could not fault any aspect of our stay. We had a beautiful state room suite with two double beds and had our two daughters (8 & 9) with us. The rooms were immaculate and very well finished. The staff were super friendly, well trained and knowledgeable. The service was the best we've had. The only issue we faced was the pool area being fully booked as spaces are limited do to COVID restrictions, but not the hotel's fault. It was  my birthday weekend and I really could not have been in a better place. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.  Of course, without the discount would have been very expensive, but still worth it for a special occasion. Highly recommended!",Sep-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Memorable Dinner Experience,Went to Tiffin Room for birthday dinner and had such a lovely evening with top notch service and warm ambience. Love the new decor. Overall makeover of the hotel is spectacular.  Tiffin Room serves delicious Indian food with a slightly modern twist. Price is reasonable for such an excellent restaurant.,Feb-20,,

I will definitely recommend my friends for the hotel stay when in Singapore.",Nov-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Superb in Every Way,"From the moment of our arrival, we were warmly welcomed into what can only be described as a  glamorous oasis, that is Raffles Hotel.  Every detail was perfect - from the breathtaking architecture and decor, to the menus & restaurants, to the genuinely caring and attentive staff.

Simply superb!",Dec-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Must do,"Obviously a very tourist thing to do. We visited on our first day in Singapore. Friendly and welcoming staff. Ordered a Singapore sling. What else would you want to ordered? Delicious. A large bag of monkey nuts on each table. Apparently you are meant to throw the shells of the nuts on the floor, but could not bring myself to do this!",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,May-20,4,Singapore sling visit,Made a quick stop via the hotel for a visit to the famous bar of the Singapore sling. Amazing service and cocktail (obviously the price of these is a little more step here) but itâ€™s the real deal. Newt renovated inside and free peanuts to munch on at the bar,Mar-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Greatest,"I used to be here once since I was a child. So many years passed, I could stay here by myself.  I was greeted by hotel staff, Chika. She was great. She explained me everything about the hotel, escorted me to the room.   The newly renovated room was great. I loved the decoration, loved the design especially the bathroom. The product used was great.  The breakfast was really great. Signature egg was awesome. The harpist was great. Every staffs seems to be really attentive. I would like to admire everyone there.   I really loved this hotel and hoped that I could have a chance to be back here every year.",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Exceptional,"We stayed here 5 days in December. Iâ€™ve stayed in any fine hotels but this is truly exceptional.

Thank you, Team Raffles for a really wonderful stay.",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Amazing hotel and first class staff,"I went to Raffles to have a Singapore sling and was not disappointed. The long bar is just wonderful and mesmerising. You can imagine in years before how it used to run. I ordered a 1915 and a Singapore sling. Both where excellent. I then went downstairs to the garden restaurant and received just wonderful service and even got told some history which bought it all to life. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. The staff where just amazing, the cocktails where superb and the food in the garden restaurant was just divine. Raffles you are simply a cut above the rest x",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,May-20,5,Great restaurant,"Great restaurant service was on point and the food was to die for. Good selection of food fast service. You get what you pay for.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Afternoon Tea not the Hotel,We had afternoon tea at Raffles. Quite exquisite and a real one time experience if you are travelling through Singapore.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Another thing ticked off our bucket list - A great experience!,"Having been to Reids in Madeira, we wanted to also do Raffles in Singapore and this week we finally fulfilled that desire.  The hotel really stands out with its brilliant white frontage and the iconic Mr Singh standing proud ready to greet the steady flow of visitors from far and wide. He was very obliging when we asked him for a photograph with him too!  The entire building that is vast, is beautifully appointed and meticulously decorated in every respect.   There are several different areas and bars to visit within this recently refurbished historic hotel, but we chose the iconic â€œLong barâ€ and opted for a Singapore sling each. A very nice beverage but an eye watering price too - but itâ€™s something we felt we had to do on the basis, that we probably would never have theâ€¦",Mar-20,,

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Old School Charm.,"A must do trip when in Singapore!. Recently refurbed,we came here for the famous Sling. Popped in the gift shop first on the ground floor then went up to the first floor and joined the queue for the Long Bar. After around 20/25 mins we finally managed to get in after a few people had left. First impressions were that it is not that big inside,and the floor was covered in nut kernals,well funny. At $35 each,we thought stuff it,only here once,so we had 2!. Bloody lovely. They do other cocktails and beer as well.",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Doesnâ€™t really get better than Raffles,"I had the great luxury of staying three nights at the newly reopened Raffles Singapore back in September. Definitely one of the top hotels where Iâ€™ve ever stayed. Impeccable service - from the greeting at the door to room service to the private butlers. My room was gorgeous, perfectly designed, comfortable, and filled with happy surprises. The Hotelsâ€™ remodel was fantastic. My favorite thing was probably the all marble bathrooms with a giant soaking tub. I couldâ€™ve happily spent three months at the hotel. The entiredesign of the rooms is fabulous. The food on site is absolutely five-star. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing around Singapore or business. I really canâ€™t say enough good stuff about it. Highly highly recommend.",Sep-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,4,Another off the Bucket list...,"We went to Singapore in February 2020 and it was on the bucket list to go into the Long Bar and try the World famous Singapore Sling. We arrived early to beat the crowds that start before 12 noon and ordered our drinks. Whilst we enjoyed the ambiance and the experience, there was something lacking in the overall experience. The service was quick but nothing special, the drink was pleasant enough but nothing special AND slurp too quick and it's gone in one! They put 5 large blocks of ice in each glass and then make a batch from one flask. Hardly the personal cocktail service you'd expect.  It has to be the most expensive drink I've ever tried but it was on the bucket list! It cost S$82 for the two, which is about Â£46.  It soon got busy and it was a case of buy another drink orâ€¦",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,Outstanding,"We booked a 2 night stay to celebrate our son's 21st Birthday. As we are unable to travel overseas Raffles seemed to be the best place to stay for a special occasion. Raffles has long been a place we have wanted to visit, and we went with high expectations. We were not disappointed, Raffles exceptional at every turn. Our suite was incredible, very tasteful and elegantly furnished, beautiful bathrooms, and a huge balcony with a wonderful view across the city to MBS. The hotel staff were fantastic, very friendly, efficient, helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. The pre booking system worked well for us, we were able to have plenty of time at the pool, and gym.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Not The Usual Raffles Experience.,"There are plenty of positive reviews which highlight the amazing hotel ground and the services provided by the staffs. It is all true and expected of from an iconic hotel such as Raffles Hotel Singapore. I would like to share an alternate experience from the usual.   The hotel exudes an intoxicating blend of luxury, history and colonial design. Butler service is amazing with the attention to details by the butlers is amazing. These aspects can almost be taken for granted as it is Raffles Hotel Singapore we are talking about here.   My young family unit stayed at the hotel during the first week of January 2020 when there was some filming within the hotel ground for a total of 3 days. Those days unfortunately coincide with part of our stay which caused some minor inconveniencesâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Fabulous. Dinner and cocktails,"We went for dinner in the Tiffin room. Great service and food. Beautiful presentation, taste, atmosphere and excellent value for money. Itâ€™s not as expensive as you might think! You might need to watch out for the prices are high for alcoholic drinks. Service charge and local taxes are included in you bill.  Top tip would be to arrive earlier and go into Writerâ€™s Bar to left of lobby and ask for a Gin Sling Ask the barman for the Writers journal which is full of wonderful information and photos of this famous hotel (Singapore Slings can be found in the Ling Bar back of the hotel)",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,4,Needed to be done - for bucket list,"Although we were only on a 1 day visit off the cruise ship , we knew that a visit to Raffles was a must . We arrived early thinking that the Long Bar was from the front , to be surprised that it was upstairs on the first floor - and a queue to get in . Not a problem as it moved quickly - and were temperature tested before entering . We ordered two gin slings , and sat for about 30 min watching what was happening - eating our monkeynuts and throwing the shells on the floor. The cost for both drinks inc tax and service charge was Â£46, but enjoyed the experience . While there we also visited their gift shop and had a look at all their displays of years gone by.",Mar-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,"Outstanding Hotel, Superb Service, decor and deluxe rooms","Raffles Hotel in Singapore is outstanding.  The service here and the high quality of the rooms are exemplary.  The charm of this establishment remains after an extensive refurbishment.  This property sets a very high standard in terms service.  The staff here are very accommodating and professional.  On site dining is excellent, though the breakfast is expensive and not always included (it really should be).  Nonetheless the rooms are deluxe, spacious and very comfortable.  While the hotel may be expensive, you get what you pay for- first class service and accommodation.  Highly recommended.",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,Stunning Hotel and Superb Service,"The rooms are beautiful, the renovation/restoration has been done so well. The hotel itself is also stunning. Would recommend the Palm Court and /or Personality Suites. They are in oldest part of the building so quite historic (and so well done that â€˜oldâ€™ is no bad thing) and spacious.  Then the service... it is, in my opinion, unmatched, there can surely be no better. There were a couple of issues before arrival but the Duty Manager, Keith, was absolutely brilliant in dealing with these and then he was excellent when we did arrive at the hotel. His attention to detail and personable approach was HUGELY appreciated.  Other staff we encountered regularly like Alex at the pool were so welcoming and again provided excellent service.  The staff at the Courtyard Bar were alsoâ€¦",Aug-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Home of the Singapore Sling,"The hotel is beautiful. The big attraction is the Long Bar...with the Long Line.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,4,Over trying,"We had afternoon tea in the Grand Lobby. The setting, staff and atmosphere was excellent. However, we thought the food was a bit of a let down. I've had better afternoon teas in some garden centres. To us it was as though the thought of ""we are raffles hotel so our afternoon tea has to be unique"" I'm afraid for us it was a bit too unique. They had really over tried to make it a little too different to any other afternoon tea you've likely to have had.",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,The most amazing experience!,"We had the most fabulous time here possible! It was a highly special stay from whoa to go! It started when we were met at Terminal One of Changi Airport by our fabulous chauffeur, Noor, who transported us to the Hotel in style and who was such a positive person, even assisting my wife with a toilet break and photo opportunities. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and everything sparkled festively. It felt like there was a Reception Committee at the Hotel once we arrived too.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,4,"No quite right, yet","Stayed four nights in Dec. An old hand having stayed many previously times we were curious to see how the refurb had panned out. There is no doubt this is a wonderful hotel, on the whole with service to match. However I am amazed at the small mistakes made by such a large hotel group. The pool area, stupidly small sized umbrellas that could just about keep off the sun if you stand directly underneath. The steps to the pool too sharp, and were closed off after our first day pending modification, things like this the hotel know. The Ah Tengs Bakery at present ( I can't believe it will not change when the rest of the ground floor outlets are finished) selling three types of pastry only, thats it, nothing else, the used to be a good little coffee shop, not an afterthought inside theâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,La Dame De Pic | Strong Contender for at least 2 stars,"My second visit to this delightful establishment and it still works its charm.  This Singapore outpost opened slightly before the last round of Michelin awards which I believe is the only reason why it hasnâ€™t gotten Stars yet.  The food & service were flawless to a fault.  Dexter, our very professional yet affable maitreâ€™d took care of the slightest of details to ensure that the lunch experience was perfect.  Ask him anything from where the wood sculpted bread bowls were from to the process of the restaurantâ€™s compound butter and the difference between washed coffee beans vs natural roast and he will deliver an impassioned explanation. That is truly impressive and a beacon of hope for our generally service impoverished F&B scene ( btw customers are not excluded from this scene. â€¦",Feb-20,,

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,A bit of history and a bit of a wait.,"While we had hoped to go to the Long Bar to have a Singapore Sling (my first alcoholic drink when I turned 21 in Boston), the wait was simply not worth it (think 40-50 minuets).  So we opted instead for going to Raffles Courtyard, a comfortable alternative.  Deciding against the Singapore Sling ($35!), we nonetheless had a refreshing glass of wine and enjoyed our time in the courtyard.",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Service and attentiveness excellent,"The hotel is breathtaking and the service impeccable. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for. We ate at La Dame de Pec, their French restaurant and was disappointed especially considering the cost. Was expecting a more classical rendering of French cuisine. The traditional use of butter and cream has been replaced with lighter fare such as various herbal substitutes which did not work for me. The tour of the hotel with a resident historian was interesting and informative. Had breakfast at the Pool Bar & Grill and it was excellent. Had dinner in room and it was also excellent. Hotel arranged a car and tour guide which was very good. Overall very satisfied with the hotel and service.",Jan-20,,

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Fantastic,"We came to Singapore 2 years ago and unfortunately Raffles was under taking a refurbishment. So this visit Raffles was on my to do list. WOW it was much better than my expectations. It was beautiful service from start to finish. It was pure luxury but without the hoity toity ness to it. The surroundings are stunning and food was delicious and was not overpriced at all. Our next visit was to the Long Bar for Singapore Sling, we had to wait about 5 minutes but sometimes this can take a good hour as people usually spend about an hour in here. The tradition is to have peanuts and leave the shells on the floor this apparently is the way it as always been. The drinks are expensive about Â£20 for 1 Singapore Sling but it has to be done. Our experience brilliant would highly recommend",Jan-20,,

Occasion was celebrating birthday and  a kind gesture by the hotel to give us a surprise desert with a birthday candle truly touched our hearts. This was totally unexpected and marks a clear difference between a 5 star experience and rest as they made us feel special.   We left satisfied  - the ambience  has a royal  feel and the food was excellent with a fantastic service.  Dal makhani was one of the best i have had till now and the gulab jamun had a twist as it had a choclate filling - different from the one we normally have. Thanks a lot Chef Kuldeep for making dining an amazing experience.   We are definitely coming back in 2021 :-) . Keep up the good work !!,Dec-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Apr-20,5,Once in a lifetime!,"Our stay at Raffles Hotel was like a fairytale come true! We have never stayed at a nicer hotel and probably never will. I am completely lost for words as Raffles Hotel took services, surroundings, technology  and professionalism to a higher lever than previously experienced. We just loved it and never wanted to leave our suite.  One thing that really fascinated us, being engineers, was how the blinds and curtains were operated via the provided ipads, then you really know that you are in Singapore! Also I must mention the breakfast, ohhhh, the breakfast, I could write about their breakfast for half an hour, BEST breakfast EVER: loads of fresh fruit, delicious Italian baked breads, crepes, pancakes, eggs - you just ask, and they have it, all enjoyed in fantastic and beautifulâ€¦",Mar-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,2 Night stay,"Weâ€™ve had the privilege of staying in some very upmarket hotels over the years, but our stay at Raffles was on a completely different level. From the moment you get there to the moment you leave there isnâ€™t enough the staff can do for you especially the butlers. The complimentary upgrade also helped. The hotel looks spectacular after itâ€™s refurbishment but hasnâ€™t lost any of its history. The entire room can be controlled from an iPad, the room is bigger than our flat in London! There are too many superlatives for this place however given the price I would have expected breakfast to be included but thatâ€™s nothing a Hawker market canâ€™t solve.

The choice was superb and our own grown Zealong tea was on offer in the speciality range. We decided a glass of champagne was necessary on a hot Singapore day, it was cooling and refreshing. The food stand; this was interesting lets start at the bottom with the sandwiches. We are not great fish eaters so the crab and tuna were not eaten although I did try the crab but no. The salmon, egg and chicken were good but to be honest nothing special and I like my sandwiches cut on the diagonal, sorry.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,Can't quite put my finger on it but.......,"From a tangible and practical point of view, it is almost impossible to fault Raffles.  The one issue that we did have on the first morning regarding gluten free meal breakfast was quickly resolved by the end of the following day. What seems to be missing is the relaxed ambience that some of the best hotels in the world manage to achieve, whilst still having the same very high standards. Part of the reason for this might be the uneasy tension between the privacy of the hotel guests and the unusually large number of non resident visitors in whose selfies you might find yourself appearing . For example opening our bedroom door and right outside on the other side of the railings were people taking selfies of themselves, and having to swiftly close the door and get out of the way.â€¦",Feb-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Fantastic afternoon tea,"In Singapore for a two day layover, so we prebooked afternoon tea at the hotel and also made sure that we were properly dressed for the occasion. We were a bit early but were treated royally by the door & reception staff and asked to wait for a few minutes. Sure enough, we were taken to our table and soon after, the fanstastic cakes,sandwiches and scones (with clotted cream & jam) arrived with our chosen tea. It was a real pleasure to sit in comfortable & beautiful surroundings listening to live harp music in the background.The waiting staff were very attentive and courteous and never pushed us along to finish. Yes, it was comparatively expensive, but a truly memorable occasion. You must do it!",Feb-20,,

From the front, the side paths lead you through towards the back of the hotel and up to the first floor, where they have recreated the colonial bar experience. Monkey nuts shells all over the floor and of course the famous Singapore Sling to quench your thirst from the intence heat outside.

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,3,Appalling service...for a Raffles.,"It once was, but it no longer is.  The renovation is just lipstick on a pig. Even thought this Property was not a pig in its glory days. The staff, is snobbish and unbecoming the service and expectations of a Raffles property. The Hotel does not exudes genuine and understated class, traits of a Grand Dame it used to be, but instead, puts forward a fake exclusivity that lacks substance at its core. This property is not iconic but a Fugazi all around. Location is good.",Feb-20,,

There are only set menus but they were very flexible with my food allergies and each person at the table could have whatever menu they wanted - unusual and very welcomed. There were many little extras: amuse bouche ; palate cleansers and petit four. The wine pairing was excellent and once again not everybody at the table had to have it. My only complaint and it was only minor was that the fish and chicken were a tad dry. Otherwise, wonderful!!",Jan-20,,
Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Lovely dinner to finish our holiday,We enjoyed a delicious but pricey drink in the Writers Bar before heading to the Tiffin room for a lovely Indian meal.

It didnâ€™t feel as though the tables were crowded together. We happened to be there on St Patrickâ€™s Day and some of the harp music reflected that. The music was in no way intrusive and added to the overall effect. The afternoon tea was very good; there were sandwiches, scones and several little cakes and pastries, sufficient for each of us to taste everything Additional little plates of goodies arrived from time to time. We expected to leave feeling slightly hungry but that wasnâ€™t the case at all. We were all more than satisfied with the quantity. As for the quality; oh it was good!

Raffles Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,Iconic hotel,We stayed for three nights in January. Collected from the airport which was very efficient and taken to the most beautiful Raffles. Building is stunning and our palm suite was large and beautiful. Staff were very helpful but we never met our Butler the whole time we were there. Swift check in in the room but no complimentary drink offered. I thought there was a slight lack of service compared to other such hotels. While it is good that there are not boards of tourists in the lobby there maybe needs to be given some thought to different access points within the hotel for guests. We had to walk right round the hotel to get to places and line up for the long bar.  Breakfast in stunning surroundings was excellent as was the service from friendly staff.

The staff are incredibly kind and took great care of us. I think the best part of the trip though was the view.

People just having drinks weâ€™re staying about an hour, and the servers are quite keen to keep people moving and the queue as low as possible.  Service was good and cocktails were served quickly.  Itâ€™s about Â£48 for two Singapore Slings, but given we were in Singapore and close to Raffles, we went for it and just enjoyed it.

Booking a getaway at a property of this caliber is a treat.  When packages go missing, phones go unanswered, food delayed, birthdays unremarked and questions left unresolved, the build up of disappointments overwhelms the beauty of the place.

I have not stayed at Raffles Singapore until this year. I actually booked the room during the 24 hour sale for my Mumâ€™s birthday and paid $1350 for 2 nights stay, a heritage dinner an autographed copy of a book about the Raffles and even a trishaw ridr.   I will say that the hotel is so good that I would definitely return soon. Iâ€™m a bigger fan of the Marriott and Hilton programs and not an Accor fan so that explains why I have not stayed here before. From tbe moment you are greeted at the entrance to the point you leave, everything is like clickwork and I cannot fault the service in anyway.

The signature Raffles Doorman was super welcoming and friendly upon checkin, and again as we were departing. What a unique and special touch. The renovated rooms are VERY nice and comfortable. We were especially pleased with the room-attendant service. Grace came to welcome us shortly after check in and helped us modify a dinner reservation that we were having difficulty with, she brought fresh milk for coffee, and she noticed our Rimowa suitcases which could be cleaned by the onsite Rimowa store. She took the suitcases and they were back within a couple of hours, freshly cleaned and wheels oiled. All in all, a great stay, next time will plan to stay longer!",Dec-19,,

I obviously wanted it to be special, and there are few more special places in Singapore than Raffles Hotel. Under normal circumstances, splashing out on a Hotel less than 500m from our apartment seemed silly, but their amazing 'Suite Life' deal made it an opportunity not to be missed.

Newly renovated and luxuriously appointed, they provide an excellent respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. The grounds are full of lush greenery and it is easy to see why so many writers have been inspired by their stay. Alas, I too have been inspired to write, and not in a positive way.  The soft product, I.e. the service, is totally wanting and unbecoming of a hotel that prides itself on its storied past and alleged standards of service.

We asked if we could wait for seats in the main bar (after all, that's what we had come for) and the staff said that was fine. As it turned out we didn't have to wait very long, only about 5 minutes. We were really pleased when we were taken through and found we had bar stools actually up at the Long Bar itself!

If you can afford to visit then Itâ€™s a bucket list thing. However, there were a few nit picky things that were slightly disappointing and this is only given the price that you pay for a room. The ceilings are thin - meaning that you can hear every single footsteps above you making for a restless sleep. Additionally they did not provide an iron or any milk which are basic amenities for a hotel room and I understand this is because they want to make money from the ironing service but very inconvenient if you just wish to iron something quickly.

A very small thing I didn't like was that I was given a table in the middle of the room and I had to request another table more quiet and comfortable and inconspicuous. I love the tiffin box at the table touch, it made the dining experience less 'buffet' like although the food all round was excellent. Wish the lunch timing was longer, felt I had to rush the lunch as it was closing at 2.30 and we had nowhere less informal in the hotel to extend having a longer post-lunch coffee.

The staff were polite and very attentive from the moment my partner and I arrived up to our departure.   I would really only fault the hotel on few points.  First, please use leaf tea instead of tea bags.  This was a real let down at breakfast time.  Tea bags are a tasteless abomination on par with instant coffee.  This is a hotel that still takes the trouble to use and look after customised silver-plated cutlery, including old-fashioned butter dishes and toast racks, so surely it can't be too much trouble to serve real tea as well, in a proper tea pot with a tea strainer.  The other problem was with the breakfast room.  There needs to a discreet sign or a manager willing to have a few discreet words with people who babble intoâ€¦",Feb-20,,

The room was spotless and of a surprisingly good size; the butler was attentive and tended to our needs well; and overall the service level was very high. The location is very convenient and well-placed next to numerous historical sites. Unfortunately the history tour of the hotel itself was way over-subscribed so we didn't have a chance to learn more about its long history; the gallery wall got us a glimpse of what would have been a very interesting story.

After two days we got a response saying that due to overwhelming demand this package is not available but we could choose for another package 50% more expensive from Oct 1st.

The rooms are a good size and quiet which was important for us and the location was just off Orchard road with a short walk to the MRT station.

The location was great especially after a long day of shopping and dinner. We didnâ€™t use the pool as it was small and boring. The premier lounge was a disappointment as there were only machine coffee, teabags, machine soft drinks, peanuts/potato chips and some biscuits. No finger food, alcohol or can drinks that you can bring back to your room. The room was small but ok, the aircon has a damp smell but we bear with it.

When we insisted that we had paid through our agent, we were told that the hotel is unaware of this. Later, we went back to sort this out and another staff asked to photocopy our itinerary and said that they will try to sort it out. All this with not even a friendly tone or reassuring smile. We then emailed our agent who swiftly sorted everything out for us and informed us via email. Unfortunately, the hotel did not even assure us of this.

It was spacious and had plush furnishings and the bed was so comfortable I found myself refusing to get out of it.   Do note that you have to book a slot for the use of the pool, and weekend breakfast slots must be strictly adhered to. The team member who checked me in assisted with the bookings.   Breakfast is served at Ash & Elm on the first floor. Once again, this hotel has adapted well to the present situation. Guests are asked to sanitise their hands whilst waiting in line, before being shown to their tables. A menu card is handed to you and one gets to chose one of four breakfast sets. Service rendered is impeccable. I love how Anne, the Director of Food & Beverage, introduced herself and said to call upon her if I needed anything during my stay.   Now that is top-notch hospitality service, as with everything else in this hotel.â€¦",Nov-20,Travelled solo,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,Second visit within a year!,"We stayed two nights in a club floor room on level 14 with access to breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in the club floor lounge on level 2 â€“ a real treat and relaxing as well.    The bed is one of the best I ever slept in including a very well working AC and windows are well isolated facing the busy Middle Road/North Bridge Road.  Bathroom is in beige marble, clean and fresh with a rather small shower room and lemon scented amenities.   We had a buffet lunch at the restaurant Ash & Elm located in the hotel â€“ highly recommended. Lots a salads, fresh bread, cold hors d'oeuvres and two different warm soups and a irresistible dessert table for approx. 28 SGD/person (20% discount if youâ€™re an IHG member).  If you want you can add a main course for additional 10 SGD . Haji Lane and Arab Street is just 750 meter away from the hotel (a must see) and donâ€™t forget to pay a visit to the ATLAS Gin Bar on your way back â€“ this famous bar (No. 8th in the world of best bars 2019) with more than 1.000 different kinds of gin and an interior thatâ€™s stunning and literally jaw dropping.   The Spectra light show outside Marina Bay Shoppes (for free â€“ 15 mins long) is worth a visit â€“ look at their website for the schedule. We were there 30 minutes in advance (for the 20.00 oâ€™clock show) and the seating area (wooden deck) was already half full.  Afterwards almost everybody walked into the Shoppes, via an escalator into the Marina Bay Sands hotel and onwards to the Gardens By the Bay and the light show.â€¦",Jan-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Oct-20,3,Disappointing staycation,"Decided to do a staycation at Intercon Singapore. As one of the Platinum Ambassador, had a free upgrade to another level of suite.   Somehow I feel that overall the hotel seems to have staff shortage issue. Whenever we request for anything, it always take quite a long while before items were sent to the room. Sometimes I had to even call back to check how come the items are still not been sent. As the intercontinental club lounge is closed, beeakfast, afternoon tea were served at Ash & Elm and evening cocktails over at the Lobby Lounge. The wait each time really needs improvement.  On one of the breakfast, there was even a strand of hair that I actually pulled out from the hash brown that I had put into my mouth. Immediately I told one of the staffs and appreciated that she offered to have the plate replaced and also the chef came over to apologised sincerely. I totally understand the tough job of all service staffs. Thus must really compliment most of the staffs are still putting on a smile despite been so busy.  Another disappointment was the sofa bed blanket was soiled and my daughter felt itchy after sleeping on it. I went to the front desk to request for change but after a long wait had to call the operator to check before they sent somebody to change it.   I had also requested for room cleaning but nobody came after 2 hours and I had to call for fresh towels because we were waiting to take our shower. When housekeeping sent over the towels, he saw the light for room cleaning was still turned on and asked if we wanted them to do it. That was already almost 3pm and we actually pressed on the roon cleaning since 1130am.  I would suggest there should be separate queue for club lounge guest and those who have no access. We all ended up having to join the long queue into Ash & Elm so what is the difference. Totally dont feel any the recognition of being in the ambassador club.  Last 2 months had also did staycation in other hotels and honest feedback Intercon Singapore stay was really a disappointment compared. â€¦",Oct-20,Travelled with family,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Nov-20,4,Finally a staycation!,"Was a tad hesitant in booking the hotel but had the flash deal voucher and thought I needed some me time.  Check in on a Thursday was smooth and the Asst GRM came in swiftly as the queue started forming.  Had made an earlier request to pay for the upgrade to a suite but I think it was unavailable then. But unfortunately, Fiona had missed out an opportunity to upsell me club benefits as I would have willingly paid for them (knowing that there would be balance of my flash deal voucher and indeed, I have left $70+ of my voucher unutilized).  Service could be a tad more welcoming at that point though, but kudos to the breakfast team as well as the malay guy who had assisted me with my checkout and purchase of parking coupon (simply smooth, fast and smiley).  Room comfortable , with constant air temperature (some rooms can get quite cold even when you increase the temperature). Water pressure is great , I have enjoyed my shower so much during this pandemic period. I just ended finding excuses just to enjoy the shower.   Understandable that some of the amenities are removed during this period, but glad to see some essentials still there such as toothbrush/toothpaste and bedroom slippers. Would be nice if they had included disposable masks but anyway , wasn't a problem since my mask dried in time the next day. Oh and the towels were amazing too! Huge and fluffy!  The in-room spotify was a great addition, I think it might be possible to hook up to our own spotify but I was too lazy to try.   On the day of checkout, I believe housekeeping were doing pest control and knocked on my door. I think she realized it after that the room was due for c/o so she left after knocking.   Breakfast .. I am not really a muffin person but the muffins are good. The staff was very nice to offer me another bread basket but I was too stuffed. But overall, it might be more satisfying to grab breakfast at one of the cafes outside if your room doesn't come with breakfast.  Overall, it's actually quite ideal for the location. I wished I had planned better to utilize my flash deal voucher, and not relying on the staff for recommendations.  â€¦",Nov-20,Travelled solo,

In all honesty, there are other Spa establishments offering full variety of facilities at the very same price, visiting just the hot tub, sauna and steam room in Spa by JW isn't worth it.   My bad for not clarifying before selecting the hotel as I thought complimentary access was given automatically. I've experienced such perks from my stays at other big brands e.g, Fairmont, Grand Hyatt, The Fullerton and One Farrer Hotel.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Sep-20,4,Birthday Staycation in March 2020,"Stayed for a night before Singapore enforced circuit breaker measures. The hotel was already well prepared with all the temperature checks etc. Check-in was smooth, balloons and cake, personalised note was made placed in the room after coming back from dinner.   My only main gripe was the framed art in the room, it's a bit scary to sleep facing it at night. Breakfast buffet spread the next morning seemed rather limited, not sure if that's the usual spread. The staff came over with a birthday cake again and sang a birthday song - only to my horror that the addressed me - 'Mandy/Wendy' and weren't sure of my name, likewise on the birthday card.

Friendly front office team and warm voices from the telephone operators and laundry team, everyone in this hotel are so delightful.  I told all my friends about you and will be back for a proper staycation to go the spa, gym, pool and not forgetting Akira Back (A regular diner with the one in Dubai).

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,3,Singapore JW Marriott  not the same standard as other countries JW Marriott.,"i booked for 3days 2 nights stay at JW Marriott, Singapore.  JW Marriott hotel standard  in KL, Jakarta, China and India are uniform except  JW Marriott in Singapore. i came with the higher expectation  as its located in Singapore and it should be  much better than those countries.  When i walked in to the hotel, the entrance really make me feel Wow such a beautiful and gorgeous place. Entrance and Lobby are good. when i walk along the corridor of the hotel room, i start feeling its like i am walking at first world hotel, Genting highland standard.  inside the hotel room, the chair, the table and the TV console exactly like Genting highland standard. its dont look like 5 stars hotel standard at all. when i want to book  for my next day breakfast, the counter staff, told me theâ€¦",Dec-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,5,A wonderful mini staycation!,"Day 3 of JW Marriottâ€™s reopening and boy was it busy! The staff was feeling it at check-in but they managed the volume well. Our room wasnâ€™t ready but they assigned us a resting room which was appreciated. COVID meant everything was managed with much more precision - swimming pool, breakfast and executive lounge bookings (high tea and cocktail evening.)   The staff was excellent and the â€˜sanitisedâ€™ diligence did not interfere with a wonderful stay. We all felt refreshed after just a one night stay (my wife and two young daughters.)   A special mention for Hazel who served us at cocktail hour and high tea, the following day. She was covering a lot of ground in the executive lounge and nothing was too much trouble.

We had a wonderful experience. From the time we arrived at the hotel, Sarah from the guest service team was waiting for us at the entrance and helped us with the check in process. All the staff at the hotel are incredibly warm and friendly which made a huge difference.  All our requests were attended to promptly.  The rooms are very nice, with very modern amenities. Our kids specially enjoyed the high speed internet, the gym and the swimming pools.  Would highly recommend the executive lounge, it has great food and drinks as well as very friendly staff. It is very well located, with multiple MRT stations closeby, great food choices, shopping malls etc., all within a few minutes walk.  Overall, weâ€¦",Dec-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Mar-20,5,Staycation,Had great service at the Executive Lounge during our weekend staycation. Great selection of drinks and food.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,4,OK Hotel.  Incredible Concierge Lounge,"I just had a two night stay at this property.  Very centrallyl located. I enjoyed my stay.  My club room was just OK.  Somewhat lacking in personality.  Electricity outlets on either side of the bed didn't work which was problematic.  The desk chair does not roll so it is not easy to move on the carpet.   The bathroom was nice however.  The lounge offering variety was spectacular.  Spoiled for choice in the mornings and the evenings.  They do need to do some work on making sure the ""hot"" foods are actually hot.  Many of the supposed warm breakfast items (mushrooms, sausage, baked beans) were hardly even lukewarm.  They certainly need to be kept much hotter.",Jan-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Aug-20,4,Great Stay.,Great service. Enjoyed the hospitality.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Mar-20,5,Spa visit fantastic as ever,"I visited the Spa at JW Marriott for the third/fourth on 18th March and was treated to the best massage yet by Therapist Hatmah. Her pressure was perfect right from the start and it was relaxing throughout the session!  I also want to commend on your spa receptionist Shakinah (i hope i spelled her name right if not i'm sorry!) for her impeccable hospitality, professionalism and product knowledge. She is always so welcoming and warm! She takes time to ask me about work and gets to know me better, something i find that is lacking in the service industry these days. Shakinah's essential oil recommendations have always hit the spot so far. Kudos to the rest of the team too!",Mar-20,,

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,One of our favorite properties,"We loved everything about of our stay here.  The hotel is incredibly modern and nice and the staff is attentive to your every need.  Our favorite part was the Executive Lounge happy hour they have for members which was extremely well organized and a place where you could have drinks before dinner.  The breakfast was also delicious.  The spa was one of the best we've ever been too.  Finally, the location was close to many of the destinations you want to go to in the marina.  Would highly recommend!",Dec-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Mar-20,5,Excellent Stay and excellent customer service.,"We had recently gone back to Singapore for several days and stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for the first time. Absolutely beautiful hotel, great accommodation and central location. All staff interactions were always very attentive and  friendly. We wanted for nothing and nothing was too much trouble. Excellent customer service was provided throughout the Hotel; from the Front Desk staff,  Concierge, Housekeeping and Restaurant staff. Our favourite place to relax after a day out and about in Singapore was the Tonic Bar where we met the very professional and  friendly Khosi. Her very broad knowledge on all things Gin is very interesting and amazing. We would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you JWM we will be back.",Mar-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,Perfect location! Amazing customer service!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for an overnight stopover for our trip.  Their welcome staff emailed us a few days before our arrival and asked what they can do to make this trip special.  I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary. Our flight arrived really early so we went to the hotel and dropped our bags so we can explore the city. By 9am, our room was ready and when we got back at night, there were cake and balloons waiting for us in our room.  The staff at the lounge were very attentive and friendly specially Hazel and Melvin.  Thank you so much for making our Singapore trip, such a wonderful and memorable experience!",Dec-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Apr-20,4,Good service but silly executive lounge dress code,"Overall great service, but silly rules for the executive lounge - they didnâ€™t allow guests wearing tank tops to enter, but allowed guests wearing shorts, crop tops and sandals. Doesnâ€™t seem to make sense and canâ€™t understand the rationale. Nevertheless special shout out to Lionel the trainee sous Chef who was very friendly and provided great service!",Apr-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Mar-20,5,One of the best spa experiences ever,"Iâ€™m not one to easily fall asleep during a massage, particularly a leg massage, but the heated massage bed and comfortable bedding made it very easy to zen out.

So, if you want comfort and luxury with a solid massage thrown in, you canâ€™t go wrong with visiting Spa by JW.",Mar-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,Excellent Service,"This is quite a new hotel with a very modern feel. That said the thing that struck me most was the great service.  It seemed at every turn there was another smiling team member eager to provide assistance. The rooms are very nice, a good size and with comfortable beds. The floor on which the gyn, pool and bar are situated is a great place to hand out. The infinity pool which looks over the city is amazing and there are lots of places to just sit and relax and read a book, enjoy a drink or whatever. A convenient location with MRT stations close by plus Suntec for shopping across the road.",Jan-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Feb-20,5,Outstanding Service and Accommodations,"We stayed at the JW Marriott Hotel for 5 nights and couldn't have been more thrilled with our stay.  Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly.  The concierge also earned points for their spot on advice (using the metro system, getting reservations at restaurants, etc).  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on.  Very sorry to have to leave its ambience and hope to return.",Jan-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Feb-20,5,12 days of great service and friendly smiles in Singapore,"The JW on Beach Road was a fantastic stay, especially for a long business stay.   The service in the Lounge was fantastic, Chef John, Olive and the bar staff became almost friends in the couple weeks that I stayed at the JW.   They made a long business trip not only bearable, but fun.   They were always happy to talk, help with anything and suggest things to do over the weekend.  Such as a great hike in MacRitchie Resevoir park. Staff at the JW Marriott make it a reason to return again.",Oct-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jul-20,5,Best 2 Weeks I Could Ask For,"Thank you, JW Marriott South Beach for what could not have been a better way to spend a 2 week Stay-Home-Notice. I feel a deep sense of reluctance to be released back into society, and much gratefulness for the hospitality given during my stay here.   They say it's contactless, but a hand drawn note from Housekeeping, the friendly voices over the phone, the multiple trips concierge makes to help deliver items that arrived at the lobby, the occasional glimpses of the team delivering meals, everything speaks of the impeccable service that the team has committed themselves to. (even the friends who came by to drop things off said how nice the staff were at the desk!)  I have already been recommending friends to consider staying here for their next trip here/staycation. And I'd loveâ€¦",Jul-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,Warm Welcome,"I had a great check in experience on the day, I went to one of staff named Lisa which I initially thought was the receptionist to be in charge of the check in process, however Lisa was actually a lobby ambassador and the check in counter was at the other side. She was very helpful and polite, showed and lead the way to the check in counter, upon seeing the counter being busy, she didnâ€™t just leave us there waiting but took the initiative to check in for us which I really see her giving an extra mile in work. On a side note, I even received a hand written card from her upon checked into the room with warm welcome that was really out of my expectation. I really appreciate for whatever she had done, and it really enhances my stay in the hotel.",Dec-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Mar-20,5,"Well located, modern hotel with excellent service","My suite wasn't ready when i checked in, but the front desk executive Wai Ying was most apologetic and invited me to the lounge for afternoon tea, and later delivered the key cards to me at the lounge. She also took the initiative to compensate me with a late checkout.   The suite was very spacious and had a beautiful, sleek and modern design, with a breathtaking view of the marina bay. The bed was supremely comfortable. The only bugbears were a  lingering, slightly pungent smell (perhaps due to strong disinfectants used against COVID-19) and the weak air-conditioning in the bedroom (set it to 19 degrees, max fan speed, and it was still warmer than the living room which was set at 22 degrees).  It was a happy coincidence to see Wai Ying at the front desk again the next day whenâ€¦",Mar-20,,

I visited the executive lounge - it had a great ambience and got to know Chef Nino who was friendly and made delicious food. Nice view of the pool. We dropped by Cool Cats too, a nice jazz joint at the back of the hotel. We also went to the spa to check it out and explored the facilities - there was a steam room, sauna, and my fave - jacuzzi with perfect temperature. I loved the space, it was a calm and serene place. A staff member named Sherry showed us around and let us try the zero gravity chair which was very cool.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,4,Good,"Stayed 2 nights with my girlfriends at the hotel. They have a clean, spacious room and the look of it is aesthetically pleasing. Comfortable bed and I absolutely love the bathtub. Hotel with the best location, just right beside the Esplanade MRT and a number of malls. Their pool at Level 18 is windy and has a great view, very instagram worthy. Now you will need to make a booking fast when you check-in to enter it though.   One thing I would comment is the service of the staff. I guess because they were too overwhelmed by the volume of guests in the hotel and lack of manpower, the staff probably had difficulty to keep up to 5 star hotel standards. Just standard check-in, check-out, no personalised service for their guests.  On the contrary, I would like to comment that the mostâ€¦",Dec-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,4,Not too cool for you...,"I had a great experience at this hotel-granted there was a very large tour group who were there when I checked in, the Marriott managed to keep me separate, and really made me feel special! The check in was a bit awkward, as my room wasnâ€™t ready @ 3p, but they were nice enough to give me a holding room until mine was ready. Unfortunately, they didnâ€™t warn me when it was, and knocked on my door, and I was completely unprepared to move, then had to wait until they forgot about me, until I had to make it happen myself. I left a personal item in the room, which they said wasnâ€™t there, until I insisted that it was, and it was delivered. Other than this snafu, I had a wonderful stay-great infinity pool area, gym, lounge, etc. I thought everyone who worked there was extremely helpful,â€¦",Jan-20,,

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Feb-20,5,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed one night to celebrate wedding anniversary. The staff Ms Jusanna, was very helpful during our check-in when we asked for a west facing room with good view. Although the hotel has allocated us a room, she made effort to search for a better room without showing any signs of frustration. She served with her heart, very genuine. Her supervisor ( Don't know her name) was guiding patiently and also helped to search.  Everything about the hotel is up to our expectations, we enjoyed our stay!",Feb-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Apr-20,5,Birthday visit was sublime,"JW Marriott took every precaution in the book to make sure we were safe, and well taken care of. They were extremely sweet to handwrite cards wishing me a happy birthday, and the Spa by JW was absolutely relaxing and refreshing. Therapists Hatmah and Mandy need to be specially commended, since they customised treatments for my fiancee and me. Azizah and Shah at the reception were also extremely knowledgeable and professional, best I've seen in any spa.   Glad that we were able to unwind safely despite the situation. Thanks to JW Marriott for keeping us safe and comfortable.",Apr-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Nov-20,5,Great stay despite restrictions,Stayed here during 2-week SHN. Lovely clean room and the hotel is well located and fairly new.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,5,Fantastic Visit - Lovely Hotel!,"Quick review... A fantastic visit to the JW Marriott Singapore Beach Road. From the start the hotel is very well designed with staff being very attentive and accommodating. It has to be said the hotel theme, design and bedroom quality is fantastic.   The pools in the hotel is very well designed and overlooks the city skyline which we found very beautiful, especially durning sunset. Thoroughly, enjoyed the table football and cocktails near the pool as well as the executive lounge.   Lovely positioned hotel near Raffles. Highly recommended.",Dec-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,"Modern design, nice lounge and breakfast","Designed by Philippe Starck, the hotel has a very modern feel. Room was ok (I feel itâ€™s smaller compared to other JWM) and some of the furnishing looked worn already.  If you get a room on the high floor, the view is splendid. Infinity pool on the 18th floor is a bit small and if you have few families, the pool seem very crowded. However the view is good. Breakfast spread is good and the loungeâ€™s food selection is excellent.",Jan-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,4,Impressive service,"Had a very pleasant staycation and we really enjoyed ourselves at the executive lounge.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,One of the best hotels in Singapore!,Most travellers to singapore prefer the marina bay sands for the hype but if you want true hospitality jw marriott south beach can offer in abundance! From early check in to a greaf breakfast to even helping out on getting back something i lost in a taxi. Thats the extent of effort they put! Breakfast is very global covering cuisines from around the world and the place is beaming with happy vibes! The place to stay if you plan on travelling to singapore. It is value for money!,Mar-19,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dec-20,5,Wonderful Staycation,"Had a wonderful staycation with the family where we were well taken care by all the staff. Kudos to Luna and her team for operating so well in these unusual times. Check-in was smooth thanks to Nazurah who ensured we understood the new norms of a hotel stay.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,Gem in the heart of South Beach,We stayed here for 5 nights as part of a longer trip between Asia and India.   The JW Marriott felt like home the moment we walked in the door (even at 0200.)   The service was never lacking and the staff was always offering to help.   We spent the majority of our hotel time in the executive lounge and were blown away by the attentiveness of the staff as well as the quality of the food offerings.  Breakfast was amazing and the evening hors dâ€™ouvres were phenomenal.  The whole staff was amazing but Hazel and Yussef stood out as shining stars.   If we are ever back in Singapore we will be staying at the JW Marriott without hesitation,Jan-20,,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Feb-20,5,The definition of service,"I was sold to the rooms of the swisshotel but trying the JW has been the best thing I could have done. The personnel is beating all previous service experiences I had. The exec lounge is great but on the low floor level (2). This is a little drawback from the 70th floor view of the Swiss. However, the JW Marriott exec lounge has a better suited in my opinion, bar area with giant screen conducive to great conversation. The swimming pool is just awesome at the 18th floor wit a breath taking view of Marina Bay and downtown SG. A little drawback is in the bathrooms. I tried 3 different room models and none had an electrical outlet in the bathroom. There is no 110V in the room altogether but te concierge quickly solved this issue by providing me with a converter.

Shaa who welcomed me at the reception was warm and friendly. She explained to me what the uses of the steam room and sauna were since I am not used to all of this and she was detailed and knowledgeable. They helped to lessen the muscle tightness that I had and I felt so much lighter. Later on I had a 1.5 hour massage done by Mandy, which I immediately fell asleep during the massage. I guess the aroma oil that she chose for me played a part and I could tell that she was skilled and experienced. Mandy was nice to let me  rest for awhile as I was too relaxed sleepy.

I donâ€™t visit spas regularly so I was a bit nervous about the whole thing of choosing the type of oil for my session, but the receptionist, Shaa, was wonderful in making me feel comfortable and looked after me from the first second I stepped in. She explained the different oils and their benefits. They even had a form for me to indicate the areas Iâ€™d like to focus on during the massage! In the end I chose the oil which would help me to destress - gardenia and rose.   Carmen was my therapist and she was so friendly and kind. Super lovely.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jan-20,5,Fantastic modern hotel,"There really is nothing bad to say about this hotel. First the service really is excellent, which is something that hotels often make empty promises about, but the JW Marriott really delivers. Very professional without being obsequious. The rooms are clean and fresh looking, with bidet toilets. I really like the couches along the windows as well. The suites have in-room Nespresso while the regular ones only have instant coffee, which is a bit disappointing. I would definitely opt for a club room, as the lounge has an elaborate food spread for breakfast, and wine, cocktails, and pretty good food in the evenings.

Terrible start to the check in where I waited 45mins because my request for nearby room which was sent in a week ago and ""duly noted and memo-ed"" by Reservations somehow was ""miscommunicated"" and so my family room and couple room were on different floors because nobody had it on record even though there was email proof. I don't blame Ms. Mary but it was really too much when she replied with ""It's not my position to say whose fault this is."" Oh, so i guess it must be MY fault for choosing this hotel then, since it's no one's fault at JW Marriott. Finally I got my room 1, but room 2 was still cleaning until 7pm.

We were very disappointed to learn our room was not yet ready. This is sub par management from an expensive and exclusive hotel. Management did, however, provide us with a temporary room and gave us access to the executive lounge which provides breakfast, snacks and evening cocktails. This was appreciated as compensation. As for the hotel its 5 star. Friendly staff. Big clean and modern rooms. Heated toilet seats with remote controlled bidet amazed my kids.

The Beach Road Kitchen offered a phenomenal breakfast with many choices. We were welcomed every morning with a bright smile from Lim Pei and they remembered our drink orders.. Chef Charles and his staff (including Gaba) treated us like royalty and was prepared to make each meal delightful. Breakfast became a smorgasbord of flavors and dishes.

I'm serving my 14 quarantine at your hotel now and I must say your food, especially breakfast is the most horrible thing Iâ€™ve experienced in Singapore.   Your food comes stale and cold, like you hate your quarantine guests.   Shame on you, especially for being a 5-star hotel for serving such horrible food. Thereâ€™s no room for horrible food in Singapore even though this is quarantine. because great food comes at such low prices in Singapore.   Shame on you again, for trying to save on such small costs and have your guests think lower of you. So disappointed.

Sometimes though, there are things that some hotels missed to check small details,  But those small things matter when a utensil or any thing we use to eat and drink are not washed and cleaned. For example, the coffee press, picture attached, I was wondering why housekeeping missed to wash it carefully and still shown little bits of coffee granules which were remained on it. Or perhaps, it is not even washed by housekeeping, I was thinking, the last guests who stayed just washed it on the sink but not fully well cleaned by them.

What a wonderful way to become at ease arriving in a strange country.  He of course escorted us all the way to the curb where we were whisked to the hotel in a fancy Mercedes.  So first off I'd recommend everyone book their airport transfer. We had a club suite both times and they bring you to the 2nd floor club lounge to check in.  Very nice.

Which is interesting, as I always thought the concept of this hotel is a gem, combining the local Peranakan culture and design with the building's architecture and aesthetics.

Check in took a while as everyone is going to staycations now, but reasonable length of time (about 15 minute wait). Room was big spacious and generally clean. Except one small issue where I found leftover food from the previous guest in the mini bar and had to call reception to send someone to take it away. Apart from that stay was generally pleasant!",Oct-20,,

At the intercontinental singapore all staff are friendly, speak&understand English and they are empathic. Example: Yesterday my wife forgot het scarf in the club, so we got a call from the club to our room to inform us about this and that a staff member was waiting at our front door with the scarf but didnâ€™t want to ring the bell as the dnd button was on,â€¦. It doesnâ€™t get more empathic )). Also fantastic was a staff member of ic waiting for us at the skybridge when we disembarked at Changi, what a service we were in the limo in no time.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Oct-20,5,Lovely rooms,"We received a complimentary upgrade to the next category during our stay so that was lovely. Thank you to Edward for assisting to arrange amenities for our anniversary. I felt that check out could be better, the agent did not go through the invoice and simply told me the amount that I need to pay. Thankfully we had the expenses sorted out so it was not a big deal this time.  The pool was quiet, maybe because it was a weekday. No staffs were there to man the poolside bar so we brought our own drinks instead.   Overall a great stay",Oct-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Nov-20,4,Relaxing Staycation,"Had a short 1 night staycation here at Intercontinental Singapore. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. My F&B experience at Ash & Elm was a hit and miss! However the hard product such as the rooms were sufficient in standard. Pool area is slightly aged but still functional. Loved that there was a jacuzzi. Service was overall... did not encounter any bad service. However, would like to make special mentions to Ng Hui Ru at Front Desk for making my stay memorable. She remembered my name even with little interaction. Honestly, its the smallest things like this that can make a stay a good or bad one. Overall, it was value for money and would definitely be back if travel is still not lifted soon. Cheers!",Nov-20,,

Lots of little cafes/restaurants near the hotel and nice shopping mall at Raffles City, 5 mins walk away.  Check-in and check-out we had to queue longer than I thought and also to get into the restaurant for breakfast, but build in this factor and you will be fine.  We had a twin bedded room with stunning views of the city to Marina Bay.   Breakfast was a little more challenging, having queue for a table but there was a wonderful lady called Joy in the restaurant (ex SQ) and it showed.  She was brilliant helping things along.  For a staycation.  It was great.  Just allow more time to check-in and out and go to breakfast",Nov-20,,

He was extremely paitient and wonderful at keeping her amused. We really felt the kindness and attention showed by the staff made our trip memorable and special.

Our longest at any Singapore hotel and choosing Intercon was indeed a great decision for us as we needed a break. Excellent all round.  Very good safe entry measures. Swift, friendly, and welcoming checkin and our room was ready even though we arrived very early for checkin.  Thanks Jean for arranging a lovely room for my husband and I.  Room was clean and made up every day and amenities topped up by housekeeping. Excellent room service for in-room breakfasts and meals.  We left feeling recharged and hope to come again.",Sep-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Apr-20,5,Still fabulous,"We stayed at the Intercontinental two years ago as our usual venue of Raffles was closed for renovation and loved it. We returned again last year as we now regard this as our new favourite hotel in Singapore. The suites are large and beautifully furnished  with everything you could want. The Club is excellent with wonderfully helpful and friendly staff. They also know the difference between ""can"" and ""may""! Amazing that you need to go all the way to Singapore for staff who understand English usage!  I hope all the wonderful staff are coping with the current situation and that we will be able to return later this year!",Nov-19,,

The staff were very helpful and friendly with any questions and setting up transportation.   The room was extremely clean and showed no wear and tear. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have experienced, which helped getting a good nights sleep. The air conditioning also worked really well.

There were some minor hiccups during the stay from the housekeeping department. But all were solved by the staffs at the club lounge.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,5,Pawcation!,"One reason why I donâ€™t do staycations much is that I do not want to leave my dog alone. So discovering that the Intercon has a package that allows to bring Rufus along is instantly appealing. And we had the best time. There were treats for him, lots of space for him to explore. The Heritage suite is lovely. And if you want to take a walk, the Bugis vicinity is perfect for that.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,4,Birthday Staycation,Had an enjoyable 2 nights stay at the hotel despite full occupancy and school holidays.  This is especially so due to a few of the memorable staff such as Fahmi at the reception when we checked-in who was patient and friendly and informative.  Dorothy from the club lounge is another excellent staff.  Always smiling and attentive.  The suites looks refurbished to me.  I had the pleasure to stay in the Premier suite for the 1st night and Royal suite for the second night and loved both of them.  Only think is that the toilets could be refurbished to a more modern look.  The same goes for the swimming pool.  Highly recommended.,Dec-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Nov-20,5,Centralised Hotel for nice STAYCATION..,"IHG hotels have always impressed me and Intercontinental is no exception.  With Safe Management Measures, check-in was slow but nothing to be too fused about.  The room was large and well maintained.  Even got a call to attend the hotel's Christmas light-up.  The hotel is  centrally located.  It is ""connected"" to Bugis Junction Shopping Mall and Bugis MRT.  You are never short of eateries esp with Jalan Sultan and Haji Lane a short walk away.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,3,"A beautiful hotel, but elite status recognition is iffy","While worn in places, this is still a beautiful hotel in general. In particular, we really enjoyed the club lounge, where the service was excellent.   Having said the above, if you are an Intercontinental Ambassador member (or considering it), do be aware that many promotional offers exclude one or more of the programme's benefits. These exclusions may not be prominently displayed to you during the booking process. Check or ask for the fine print and take screenshots.   In my own experience, I thought both the hotel and Ambassador Services handled this issue rather poorly, without directly addressing the issues I pointed out. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon, and I'm not sure about membership renewalâ€¦",Dec-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,5,Satisfying Staycation!,"Booked a promotion staycation package with dining credits, experience was great from start to end! Service from all areas of the hotel were impeccable. Used the dining credits at Man Fu Yuan, which served really good Chinese food. There were some unexpected delays during checkin and we were given a later checkout on top of the late checkout from the package, which was a nice gesture.   Room is nice, with comfy beds, large screen TV and a nice shower area with bathtub. There is also a special gingerbread man decoration activity (optional) that we can participate on our own time in the room, we understood this will be displayed in a bigger Christmas decoration later.

Got to the room and called in to ask to ask for cutlery, hdmi cable and cotton buds (which was not even provided in the first place, why??) and I had 3 doorbells rung visited by 3 different hotel staff. Why canâ€™t the staff just collate everything and deliver once and for all? Inconvenience.  For a 5-star hotel, Iâ€™m truly disappointed with the service management. As a platinum elite member, we also wished the bar was at least stocked with soft drinks.   Pool was alright.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Mar-20,5,Always Love Our Stay Here,"The hotel lived up to our memories and expectations.  The staff were super friendly and helpful, and nothing was a problem.  They went out of their way to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay in the midst of the Corona Virus situation, and their Executive Club is something we always enjoy.  There are no areas where I could recommend improvement as, for our experience, nothing was less than expected.  I highly recommend the hotel, and the area in general, and there are multiple eating options immediately around the hotel.",Mar-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,BEST LOCATION AND AWESOME SERVICES,"The hotel has an exceptionally good exterior and even better interior. With one of the best locations in Singapore, this hotel is a tourist haven. Its next to the food street of Buggis and malls. The Ambassador checkin / checkout was swift and easy. The rooms are big and spacious. House keeping is doing a great job in keeping them clean. Due to the new year, the hotel was fully booked but we never had a problem with any of the services. The concierge services are very helpful. They helped us for booking of tour packages and guiding us to move around in the city. Would love to stay here again and again.",Jan-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,Amazing stay again,"My husband and I had an amazing 10 days here and from start to finish we only received exemplary service from everyone we met. We were lucky enough to get an early check in after our long flight which was great.

We would recommend this hotel without hesitation,so much so that we cant wait to return in April.",Nov-19,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,Honeymoon stay,"The hotel is very luxurious. Location is ideal as it is very central, the metro station is within the hotel and they have a mall connected to it as well. The rooms are nice, we booked a room in the heritage wing, the interior was very nice and they have all needed amenities. The concierge is very helpful they helped us plan our schedule and gave us best tips. Breakfast is good, as they have a wide variety of items in the buffet.

The Club is a home away from home for us ... we are always warmly welcomed and our particular requirements are always anticipated and prepared in advance, which is very much appreciated. There are still a few familiar faces there who always greet us - the wonderful Anna, and Fiona, Ain, Wai kit and Shi Min, who all clearly love their job and their guests; we have noticed some turnover during our last couple of stays, hopefully these familiar faces will remain, they are one key reason we always return.

After traveling to Singapore for work for 4 years, I now live here and got an opportunity for a staycation at the InterContinental since my parents were visiting from the US.   Yet again the InterContinental met and exceeded all expectations. Itâ€™s tremendously clean, sophisticated, and superbly well maintained. It is truly a 5-star hotel. To pair with the 5-star experience, the Club Lounge is the favorite part for my wife and I. Weâ€™ve made great friends with a number of the staff that still recognize us even after having been away for almost a year. They even remembered my usual breakfast order!â€¦",Feb-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Feb-20,5,Fabulous Oasis in Singapore,"We ended up in Singapore after several weeks in Asia. We were ready to get home, but wanted to enjoy a few days in the city before our long trip back to the USA. We choose the InterContinental because our experience with them has always been good. We upgraded to a club suite to enjoy the extra amenities offered. We were not disappointed! We had a wonderful stay! The service was outstanding, the rooms were spacious and well appointed, and the location was perfect for everything we wanted to do. We loved the food and service in the club. We also really enjoyed the pool area. Another highlight was the live music in the lobby/coffee shop area during high tea time in the afternoons.

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,Beautiful old school hotel with modern features,"This was a very pretty hotel, the architecture was amazing to look at. The hotel itself was clean and had all the modern features you would expect of a hotel of this calibre. The rooms were well equipped, clean and everything functioned as expected. The staff on arrival are warm and welcoming. This hotel is situated about 15 mins walk from Haji lane ( if you are familiar with that ) and there are plenty of things to do around there.. Its location was not too far away from Marina Bay either and in my opinion, this hotel is much nicer the MBS.  Dont hesitate to stay here",Jan-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Mar-20,3,Downward Spiral...!,"This property has really taken a direction for the worse.  I'm really shocked by the severe lack of staff especially at the restaurant.   No staff at the entrance, cold cuts completely empty, bakery section empty, juices gone, eggs not being prepared for 35+ minutes. Dirty dishes on every table. Why is there no staff on the roster to make sure the restaurant runs properly?  The room keys stopped working three times in the 24h I was at the hotel. Whenever you contact the front desk there are some excuses, enough with this nonsense. Was offered 5000 points (worth ~$10) as an apology upon checkout. Keep it, what a joke!",Feb-20,,

I was so moved by this! Thank you, InterContinental Singapore.",Mar-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Mar-20,4,Breakfast was disappointing,"Hotel with nice heritage theme both exterior as well as interior. Room was nice and functional and the bed was very comfortable which is typical for IC hotels.   We booked the Weekend Jump Start deal which included breakfast & it was rather disappointing. Most Asian dishes were not tasty. Service at the buffet was good. Found the jazz music too loud & intrusive first thing in the morning especially when a number of business people were discussing work going over charts etc., may be it was catering for the young demographic.   Check in was quick and smooth. Used the concierge for directions and the staff we had encountered were very knowledgeable, friendly really excellent.",Oct-19,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Jan-20,5,Beautiful Hotel,"I absolutely adored staying at the InterContinental Singapore. It is a beautiful hotel with lovely staff. It is refreshing, well air conditioned, beautiful lounge and lovely rooms. The only thing I would say is that it is quite large so it was quite a trek to get to our heritage room, but other than that it was honestly beautiful.  The location is interesting - it is a close walk to Raffles but a little bit 'where am I?' - when we returned we stayed in Marina Bay area which did feel more central and closer to the CBD. Otherwise, to be slightly removed this hotel was great. One of the staff recommended going to the Chjimes which is close by and a really cool fun place to eat.  Overall BEAUTIFUL hotel and would absolutely stay there again.",Jan-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Sep-20,2,Not the standard I was expecting,"After reading all the good reviews and excellent services provided by InterCont, I have decided to make a booking for a suite to propose to my partner in the upcoming month. I contacted the hotel to check if any additional arrangement or services can be made.   I was then referred to purchase their room decor package, however, I have already gotten my own decorations. Following which, the staff replied that they do not provide any thing else apart from their own room decor package. No other assistance or services offered.  I was rather taken back by their replies and definitely not what I was expecting from InterCont. Maybe I have set my standards too high but I was very disappointed.  I am reconsidering if I should proceed to hold my proposal at InterCont now.",Sep-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,2,Poor service,"For a 5 star hotel i was quite disappointed. Went there to celebrate a friendâ€™s birthday. Service didnt feel like 5 star at all. Felt more like 2/3 stars. Everyone was quite cold and seemed like they did not want us around. The only one who was friendly was the housekeeping runner. The phone operator even spoke singlish to my friend, answering her questions sarcastically, I felt as though i was in a budget hotel!",Nov-20,,
"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Mar-20,5,Best Hotel staff ever,"From check in to check out the staff were amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. They were all friendly, helpful and attentive. The staff in the Club Lounge were superb. I couldn't name one above the others as they were all equally as great. The same level of service was experienced at breakfast. We had booked the flash sale deal. This was great value but came with a penalty if you had to leave early. Unfortunately we had to leave two days early as countries were closing their borders due to Covid-19. When I explained our situation to Suhasini at reception she immediately waived any penalties. She was so helpful and friendly and so professional. Our room was lovely and very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location for exploring Singapore.

Firstly there were no teepee set up, and no children bathroom amentites. And NO Gingerbread men kit that was supposed to be included. We called recption twice and they say will check! But nothing was delivered.   Next we booked the pool for 4pm, it was so crowded (about 20pax), tho they mentioned at anytime max is 10pax!

The pool and jacuzzi were especially popular with my kids - we were there every single day of our stay. And the hotelâ€™s location is hard to beat. A shopping mall next door, eateries everywhere and the train station within a short walking distance.  We had a truly wonderful staycation and I wished it had been longer. Special mention goes to Ms Anna Yap who was particularly attentive - my wife only mentioned my recent birthday in passing but guess what? She surprised us with a little sweet treat that we got to enjoy with our little girls. Thank you for that warm & personal touch.",Oct-20,,

"InterContinental Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Feb-20,5,Always a pleasure to stay,The Intercontinental is our first choice when visiting Singapore. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming making any stay feel like you are one more than just a guest. Rooms are always clean and fresh and guarantee a good nights sleep. A club room is always our choice as the lounge is perfect for relaxing as well as having great breakfasts on offer. The crew in the lounge are and always have been so attentive that you feel as though you are part of their family. Can't recommend the Intercontinental high enough.

We loved every minute of our stay. Even with a 4 month old we were made to feel very welcome. Having breakfast and afternoon tea in the club lounge and enjoying cocktails in the main bar.  The real point of difference is allowing travelers with children to enjoy the benefits of the club lounge away from the lounge. i.e As children are not allowed in the lounge for evening drinks you are still invited to have them in the main bar on the ground floor.  The service was great and always friendly.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Mar-20,4,Donâ€™t miss Club Millesime!,"This is an excellent hotel in the Tanjong Pagar area of Singapore, not far from Chinatown. It has the advantage of being reasonably easy to access a lot of the touristy elements of Singapore, while being relatively quiet in the evenings - notwithstanding the queues for several local restaurants. We had a club room for three nights with a Luxury Escapes deal. The club itself is wonderful. Thereâ€™s an outdoor area overlooking a lush mini-garden and the pool which is a great spot to sit and enjoy the complimentary champagne in the evenings, plus some very good snacks.   It was a shame, due to the Covid-19 issue, that the Club had only the most basic offering for breakfast and we were directed to the main Racines restaurant. This wasnâ€™t at all good. The food offering there seemedâ€¦",Mar-20,,

Is more catered to business travellers. The bathroom has the best layout and how is designed except not enough hook only one.  The breakfast is great at raccines. The gym is small but the pool has a good length. The housekeeping staff name Rachel is remarkable as she remembered your preferences.   She is  wry prompt and efficient. Just that the bed and pillows are too soft for my preferences.  The location is excellent as the MRT is just below the hotel.  The place is full of restaurants and amenities.,Dec-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Apr-20,4,Staycation amidst the situation,I had a hotel stay complimentary that is expiring so we decided to use.

Overall service is as good, especially staff at the front office and the restaurant, Racines. We had breakfast, lunch, and dinner at Racines.   I would like to thank Indra (front office manager) and Dominic (F&B manager) for thoughtful arrangements during our stay. Special praise to Michelle at Racines. She is friendly and helpful, served us well and gave us good advice on food to order at the restaurant.

We are going to Singapore again two weeks later, and have already booked to stay there for the three time.",Jan-20,,

The suite was spacious, comfortable and beautifully appointed. There was an eye for fine detail evident everywhere. This made it feel both luxurious and welcoming. The hotel is fairly new. It has been designed with careful thought both aesthetically and practically. It has been meticulously maintained. The club access was excellent value with good food, generous beverages and a relaxing outlook. The rooftop pool and garden area was a welcome respite from the city. The gym was well appointed. I can highly recommend this hotel.",Jan-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,4,Great stay,"We visit Singapore at least once a year as a family member now works there. We stay in a different hotel each time.  Sofitel City Centre has been the best of 5 weâ€™ve stayed at. They provided a warm welcome. The room was large, functional and stylish. It had everything we needed for our stay. The infinity pool is big and refreshing although the area could do with more shady trees (think ParkRoyal on Pickering).  The hotel is located in Tanjong Pagar and on top of the train station there. We didnâ€™t eat here as there are numerous and diverse range of eateries, restaurants and good coffee shops in the area.  The drinks at the bar were fab.  Weâ€™d stay here again.",Feb-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Nov-20,5,A great stay will return,"Stayed there a couple of nights in 2019 pre-Covid time during Singapore Fomular 1. The hotel is quite flawless. Nicely decorated lobby with fresh beautiful flower arrangements. Staffs are all friendly.  Lots of choices for breakfast, appreciate the Asian selection. The executive lounge is once of the nicest Exec lounge with plenty of high quality selection. A larger hotel room for Singapore hotel room standard. Sofitel bed is comfortable as always. The location is perfect. Will definitely return.",Dec-19,,

Room is spacious, very comfortable, and view overlooking shop houses is stunning! Though the hotel is in the busy town, inside of the property is a totally different feel.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,3,VIP to a VAP,"I was really looking forward to the stay at Sofitel City Centre Singapore. Within 15 minutes that idea was quashed. Check in should have been seamless, however this wasnâ€™t the case. I felt like a Very Average Person rather than a VIP, no upgrade, no acknowledgement of being a platinum member, no direction to the elevators and a rude attitude by so called â€œClubâ€ staff. The room was excellent, great size and had a bath. It was handy to be able to have 1 x free laundry. Food was average to good in both restaurant and club lounge. This hotel is ideally placed for the MRT station and China Town. This hotel is soulless and some staff have little idea of service. In one word â€œdisappointingâ€ such a shame.",Jan-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Nov-20,5,Great Experience,"The room was really spacious, well-lit, and clean. Check-in was smooth and we were briefed with the instructions and the measures they implemented due to the Covid-19.

The hotel gave us a call on the morning itself and told us we can do an early check-in. Got upgraded to a room on the club floor with a nice view (without club access). As an Accor member, we got 2 welcome drinks at 1864 and it was really good.  Room is really nice and clean. My mum loves the bed so much, she wants to get the exact replica for our home ðŸ˜… Because of covid, we needed to request for slippers, bathrobes etc but service is very prompt, so kudos to Sofitel for that!

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,2,Not worth the value,"I'm Accorplus gold member has been stay at sofitel and other accor hotel, this trips is the most unsatisfying stay at sofitel singapore city centre , the staff service was bad , executive lounge was lousy , no much food or drinks available for serving , no staff top up the food or drink when is run out , no update when I request for last check out . Have to keep asking the staff from night to next morning . End of the days I still cant get the late check out, they should update me earlier Yes or no so I can plan my schedule.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Sep-20,5,Excellent hotel stay experience,"I have to say sofitel never fail to exceed expectations amid all the extra measures put in place for covid. No compromise on the excellent quality of Sofitel brand in terms of the high service level, comfy luxurious room, amenities, etc On the previous reviewer comment on food portion and late checkout, realistic expectation has to be there -food portion : no restaurant would indicate food portion (be it big or small). Just order what is needed and reorder if not enough -late checkout : itâ€™s a fair to understand that there is no guarantee as itâ€™s subjected to availability   Will surely return for another stay. Was an relaxing and refreshing experience",Sep-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Great location perfect place to relax,This hotel has everything and more. We booked 3 nights stay with the Club Room access. The room was very nicely appointed and very quiet. The pool is a great place to relax and there is access the Virgin Active gym if you want to do a work out. The staff have been very accommodating and helpful in advising us on how to get around this wonderful city. Would definitely stay here again.,Jan-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Such a great hotel,"I was in Sofitel hotel for a five days. Great location, next to metro station, near so many attractions. But the best was the staff, especially in breakfast restaurant. I would like to say huge thank you to Mr. Push whose was remembering about my special diet. Everyday he was preparing me a different fantastic breakfast. Thank you so much for that! I really do recommend it and next time when I will be in Singapore, I will definitely choose the same hotel.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Brilliant Location and Hotel.,We spent five nights at this fabulous hotel where the service is five star everyday. We were treated so well from the executive lounge to the restaurant to the front desk. The hotel is so close to the MRT just underneath  we used this service so much.,Dec-19,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Luxury and refined art combined,"Most 5 star hotels talk about luxury,but truly the Sofitel Singapore city center will exceed the expectations even for the frequent traveler.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,5,Short Holiday,"A great central place to stay, quite a new hotel too.Enjoyed the suite upgrade with plenty of very modern comfortable space. We used the lounge daily & there was a reasonable selection of food & drinks. The minibar was next to useless with such a miserable selection of only 3 snacks, no chocolate even! the only one we tried that looked OK tasted awful. Only 3 coffee pods for us to choose and tea was also in short supply -but we did get more after asking and the TWG teas are great.The pool area is quite small and if you are looking for more, then Sofitel resort & Spa Sentosa Island is a much better choice.",Feb-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Dec-20,5,THE hotel,"we booked this hotel after seeing the many reviews online. decided to choose the suite since we brought our 2 darlings with us. from the point of booking, Ms Chandani attended to our every request with absolute tip top service. we needed few things in particular cause we have 2 kids with us.  Day of check in, the hotel's atmosphere was wonderful. what wow-ed us was every single person we met from the hotel, made my 2 kids really comfortable. From lunch at the restaurant where they offered my lil boy something apart from the menu so that he could have a proper lunch to everything requested earlier with Ms Chandani was all perfectly in place in the room.

Check in was smooth and detailed, no issues with pre booking swimming pools and gym as it was done before check in. Room was super clean and neat. Nice touch of care pack. Some non essential amenities were not present but you can always request them if need to. Bed is super comfy, wifi. tv system, bose and aircon were all good. Awesome service from literally everyone in the hotel. Everyone i meet are all super nice and professional. Breakfast at Racines has a limited menu and its on ala carte buffet. Cakes at Racines super duper nice! It's such an awesome staycay!!",Dec-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Oct-20,3,High tea,"The cheapest high tea I ever had. Food was reasonably good, $78 for 2 pax. There was a 50% promo going on. It was a surprise.  Ambience was average but for the price that we paid, we were happy.  The tea that they served was TWG, coffee was Nespresso. Scones were lovely, mini sandwiches was good but they left the crust on which made the sandwiches slightly tougher.  Half of the sweets were good, the remaining was either too sweet, bland or tough.",Oct-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Nov-20,4,My first experience in this hotel,"Bad experience having breakfast on 16 Nov, next table found a lots on the table so the guest requested to move to another table before they started eating. We already started eating our breakfast so we didnâ€™t request to change our table. Later we have to run off out of the restaurant without finishing our breakfast because we found ants on our body. I have informed the staff before I left the restaurant in distress.",Nov-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,4,Nice Hotel,"Nice new hotel, however : 1) Expected more restaurants. They only have one. 2) Only get access to Virgin gym if you have an executive room. This isn't what was advertised. Hotel gym is OK but not the virgin gym re facilities 3) Free unlimited Inclusive mini bar is very very poor i.e. only 4 local soft drinks and not even a coke or a sprite. Compared to Andaz Hotels which are similarly priced where they have a proper free mini bar which includes alcohol this is false marketing by Accor. 4) Hotel bar closes far too early for a 5 star hotel 5) Bar tenders are very good though - Kelvin in particular.",Feb-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,1,Not worthy of being part of the Sofitel chain,Check-in at the club lounge was bad with no directions on how to get to the room nor the amenities provided. Service was inconsistent during our stay and not in line with a 5 star hotel.  Had to pay ~$50/day for parking despite having paid ~$700/night for the hotel room. The unsympathetic response was â€œwe canâ€™t do anything because the building doesnâ€™t belong to usâ€. But we later found out that F&B customers get complimentary carpark with min spend of $100. Guess the hotel doesnâ€™t value local hotel guests.,Dec-19,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Aug-20,5,Sofitel Staycation,"Booked a staycation package that comes with 3 course dinner and breakfast for 2. Overall service is excellent.   Room: Comfy bed, spacious room and bathroom with bathtub. Complimentary disinfectant wipes! Love the Bose speakers as well.  Dinner: Enjoyable, 3 course menu available for selection.   Breakfast: Buffet breakfast can be ordered via online website through qr code. Quality is superb, most of the dishes are delicious and seems better than most hotel standard fare of the same price range. Portion is not huge so we can try a variety of items. Chef personally greeted the patrons.",Aug-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Amazing,We stayed at the Sofitel for 7 days what an amazing place the people are very accommodating and the room was five star.   The food was AMAZING the best fresh food with a twist of French. The club was the best part at the end of each day we looked forwarded to relaxing with canapÃ©s and a few drinks Daniel was very accommodating with the best customer service offered at all times.   We complemented the chef whom came out and introduced himself personally to thank us.   If this is not a testament that the Sofitel has reached every expectation that we had is definitely an understatement.   We have left feeling totally spoilt with the food and the lovely staff who took care of us.   Thankyou Sofitel we will definitely be recommending your hotel to everyone back home.   Wellâ€¦,Jan-20,,

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Jan-20,5,Staycation,"This year we chose Sofitel Singapore City Centre for our yearly staycation plan with my family.   Our room was spacious enough for 3 of us. My daughter enjoy the pool area a lot. We took many scenic photos with different high rise buildings around us. We can also access the executive lounge for light drinks which is just beside the pool section.   At Club Millesime, they serve wide variety of food during the evening reception.  The Club staffs in particular Mr Ben Tee has greeted us warmly. He was very friendly and helpful to our needs.   Though it was a short stay, we already planning to make another staycation this year at this hotel. I am sure we will have more time to explore around the hotel.",Jan-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Dec-20,3,Reduced amenities,"Booked a suite. Room was bare & air con not on. Called front desk & they rectified it quickly.   Club lounge was a disappointment - only water, coffee & tea. No snacks. They only provide light refrsshments at cocktail hour - you get food & alcohol for an hour.  Breakfast was ok. Nothing to shout about.  All in, would say hotel was ok but wish they would improve the drinks list & snacks on offer in the lounge.  Also the minibar is only topped up once - when we called, they told us that there is no 2nd top up.",Aug-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,5,Magnifique,"Located centrally to quite a number of tourist attractions, this new Sofitel establishment is a wonderful lush escape and a refreshing contrast to the concrete jungle. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly. The room was spacious, clean and fitted with the latest modern amenities. As usual, the Lanvin toiletries were a treat.  The pool on level 6 is refreshing on those hot afternoons and so was the chill out in the Club Millesime.  The buffet breakfast spread was bountiful and the food fresh and delicious. Western and eastern favorites were to be had.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Aug-20,5,Great service and luxurious atmosphere,Had a great staycation at the Sofitel City Centre. There was a mix up in our booking. But the manager at the front desk rectified it and was very gracious. He even upgraded our room to a suite and gave us a late checkout. We really appreciated it.  The suite was very spacious with beautiful interiors. Luxurious furnishings and well appointed. We had a delicious breakfast and a lovely high tea as well. All orders had to be made through mobile via a QR code which is good for safe distancing.  Gym and pool facilities were also very nice. For now you have to make a booking for the use of these facilities but we had no problems making the bookings at all. It felt safe knowing that the numbers are being controlled.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Dec-20,4,Great experience for family,"Check in was fast and hassle free. However, noticed the gap in information exchange between front desk and booking. Instructions was not passed down properly.  Staff were attentive and can still â€œseeâ€ their smiling face behind the mask. Room was clean and very comfortable. Meals was well organised to enable guest to keep to social distancing. I see that such also helps to reduce food wastage.   The ordering system at the restaurant needs to be further tighten. I have ordered Butter & Jam twice and they did not seems to capture it.  Overall, a great place to stay and enjoy some getaway.",Dec-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Dec-20,4,Great Stay,"The suite met my expectation and so were the amenities in the room. The service level at the reception and club lounge were exceptionally warm, kudos to Veronica and Adi, both of them displayed first class customer service level. The food needs better attention though:  the display of food served at the club lounge was miserable and the breakfast was served cold.  This was much below expectation and I attributed it to the Covid-19 pandemic as Sofitel, as I know, serves good food. Thank you.",Dec-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Aug-20,5,Excellent staycation!,"Thanks for the impeccable service, especially Housekeeping, Thao at reception and the people at the gym and pool.

Enjoyed the pool area, you do not feel like you are in the city centre. QR code on amenities which can be requested does not include the full list (e.g. bath salts) and it is a pity that turndown service is not provided nor can the turndown cookies be requested, as I enjoyed that a lot on a previous stay. I do wish there were more hanging spaces or hangers in the room. Lighting can also be a little soft or at strange angles. Everything else was perfect - room size, furnishing and types of furniture, power outlet placements, and nice natural light from the full windows.",Oct-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Nov-20,5,Living up to the standards of Sofitel,"Stayed at Sofitel Singapore City Centre over last weekend and checked into the Prestige Suite. Had some issues with the lighting in the Bedroom which happened throughout the night. The following morning Mr Indra approached me and offered a room switch, he showed genuine concern and apologised even though it wasn't his mistake. An apology note, as well as a box of Afternoon Tea set was placed in the room. I would like to Thank Mr Indra for his outstanding and compassionate service, his hospitality shown has truly helped to enrich my hotel stay. I will not hesistate to recommend the hotel to my friends and would love to stay there again!",Nov-20,,

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Aug-20,5,Wonderful Staycation-felt like we were on a real holiday,"Stayed for one night over the National Day weekend in the Prestige Suite room. Despite the safe management measures, the amenities (like the Hermes toileteries) were all there and if they were not, you could call to request for them (like pillow choice, bedroom slippers). The Millesime lounge service was still good as before, despite the limited timing (6-7pm,) and no buffet evening cocktails. You could order ala carte for the snacks and drinks. This applied to the breakfast. No buffet spread but the unlimited ala-carte more than made it for it. Also had dinner at the Racines, and even with the limited menu, the quality was still there. My family felt as though we were in a hotel in another country. A great stay. Will be back.",Aug-20,,
Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Nov-20,5,Beautiful pool,The infinity pool on the 6th floor was lovely. Pool usage timings were staggered (and bookable online) due to Covid-19 and it felt very safe.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,Feb-20,5,A beautiful gem in the city,"A really lovely hotel in the middle of businesses in Singapore. The MRT station is literally in this building, so you dont have to walk many steps to get to the train. The service is of 5* quality and the bfast matches this. We had book 3rooms, which were nice and spacious with a shower and bath tub. Wifi everywhere and room service whenever you need it. Hi tech surveillance and access to the rooms, so not just anyone can come to your room unless you share a floor. Very clean and good coffee and tea facilies, bar fridge, make sure you ask them to empty it if you dont want to be charged extra. Really enjoyed our 5nights in this gem.",Jan-20,,

Nothing negative about the room which I can think of, and excellent bathtub.   Lounge Club Millesime during cocktail hour was quite busy and packed, fortunately there were 2 sessions catered. Food were served in bite size small bowls and the lounge was pretty generous with their champagne (how cool in expensive Singapore!) and wine. They have their own very craft beers, which although interesting, didn't quite sit well with my palette.   Gym and swimming pool can be booked via online which system could probably be improved for ease of use.

Location is so convenient just above Tanjong Pagar MRT and area has plenty of food choices. (Highly recommend Keisuke Hamburg just across the Hotel)  Service and ambience in the Hotel is top notch, it is a class above. Love how they use gigantic bears to socially distance, instead of ugly big Xs in other places. The pool area is small but lovely to hang out at. It is so tranquil that it's hard to believe we are in the middle of the CBD. The great view and instagram worthy backdrop is a bonus!  We had dinner at Racines and Afternoon Tea at 1846.

Itâ€™s room quality and front desk services maintained its usual standards even though there appeared to be a drop in the number of staff on duty likely due to Covid-19 pandemic.  The dinner bill at Raccines has increased quite a bit likely due to a revision in their pricing. What is confusing is that in previous visits there are discounts for the drinks but this round none.  At the lounge we encountered conflicting service quality from the staff. The first waitress who seated us did not appear happy when we arrived at 9.45pm and told us that they are closing at 10.30am and that our first order will be the last order.

He showed us the room and the functionality, it also help that he could speak Malay so that we feel at ease asking questions. Before that, we checked in at the club millesime while waiting our room to be ready and the lounge attendant give us refreshing drinks.

Firstly check-in: Check in was quick, the front desk counter is small and only manned by 2 staff at a time, can't imagine how it'd be like during peak times. Welcome drink was a mix of fruit juices served in a test-tube. An interesting touch and i'll give points for that!

When I got into the room, I noticed that there was a pile of dust / wood shavings near the main work desk. Thinking that it was simply a stain, I cleaned it off myself and thought nothing of it, despite my concerns of a termite infestation. However, the next morning I woke up to the same wood shavings in the same spot. I reported this to the duty manager before I checked out who apologised profusely and assured me that they would investigate and rectify this immediately by blocking off the room (233).

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,4,"Cozy and adequate, but little short of charming and memorable.","At flash sale rates, you can't complain, otherwise, you may find it difficult to justify the price. The base category rooms are a bit small with a relatively tiny pool and no Spa to speak of (within the premises). The rooftop pool provides a pleasant view, albeit surrounded by other buildings. But there's no denying the slightly cramped sense of space throughout the hotel. From this specific perspective, there are equivalent and maybe better value for money options elsewhere in the city.  The Sofitel brand charm was supposed to be the draw, but somehow, I couldn't detect and feel that magnetism. Breakfast is average at best and there are very few cut fruits on offer, which I found a bit odd.

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,3,Not as nice as I expected.,The hotel is much more beautiful in the pictures. The French style rooms are well decorated but the rest of the hotel is quite confusing. The staff was not friendly....only the door man was nice to us. The rooms were not very clean. Unfortunately I did not have a nice experience.,Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Apr-20,4,Why not So/Sofitel,"The hotel is in a good location. The hotel is clean and small. The beds are comfortable and the showers are super comfortable. Most hotels in Singapore are overpriced, but this one is quite alright. The front desk is very friendly. In terms of breakfast, itâ€™s a bit average.",Jun-19,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,4,Great location and service,"Stayed here for 4 nights in late January during Chinese New Year. Overall a very pleasant experience and attentive service from staff (big thank you to Ben and others at Concierge team). The location in walking distance to Marina Bay area, Chinatown etc is convenient.   The roof top pool is ok for quick dip and cool down but area is small and not designed for extended pool lounge sessions as surrounded by tall CBD buildings blocking the sun. Also only very limited sun lounges.  Not atypical of hotels these days in general, bathroom lighting was poor and could be improved, at least around the separate make-up mirror area. But otherwise our room was excellent, balcony ok but not really all that useful as facing street and quite noisy from passing traffic.",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Vacation,"Concierge Ben and Jeffrey were pleasant, courteous, friendly, very polite  always available to assist and very accommodating. They always greet us with a smile. Enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend SO/Sofitel Singapore to my friends and family.",Jan-20,,

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Oct-20,5,Amazing!,"I stayed at SO/ Sofitel in October 2019 and it did not disappoint! The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The bathrooms were also large and very nice. My Family & I were her for my dad's 60th and we had 3 rooms, i am grateful that my brother and i also received and upgrade for our rooms. The macarons that we also received was an awesome bonus. The location is quite good. Telok Ayer Market is right in front for some yummy food and it is just a short walk to Marina Bay. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made the stay even more pleasant. I look forward to ccoming back when i can.",Nov-19,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jun-20,5,Appreciated your staff extraordinary services,"The services rendered by your staff are excellent.  The hotel is located right in the central business district area and near to many food centres.  This morning I was touched by your front office staff who rendered extraordinary service to me  by furnishing me a thermometer in time of need, during this challenging time.",Jun-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,3,Hotel guests should be priority,"The hotel is beautiful, excellent room, incredible bed , lovely linens, great reception, great bellman. The issue I have with this hotel is that the pool area and bar ( which is brilliant for atmosphere) has to decide who they are catering to ?, either paying  Hotel guest or locals that are using the bar and the pool facilities ...I witnessed twice hotel guests come to the pool area and leave when there were no loungers to sit on and waited endlessly for service for a drink or lunch...we waited for 15 minutes for someone to just acknowledge us...this is a HUGE issue ..It was a big disappointment, as this was not 5 star standards.",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,3,Not at the level expected for a 5 stars hotel,"I've been staying a couple of times at the Sofitel So over the last 5 years and this last experience was the worst. I've tried to get an advice for a restaurant but it got no proper answer, i had to make 2 bookings and of course the key card was not properly set-up, I went to the swimming pool on Saturday morning at 10.00 am and nobody was there if you want a coffee or a glass of water and when you mention it to the reception, the answer was ""that's normal"".... The location is good and the hotel is nice but for for the price paid, go to the Andaz... Very disappointing",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,2,Disappointing,"A beautiful building in a great location with a comfortable bed but otherwise very disappointing. Checking in took too long, bathroom lighting very poor, very stingy selection of â€œfreeâ€ mini bar items, no cold wine or beer in mini bar fridge, breakfast service was chaotic (used plates not cleared, tea/coffee not refilled, menu card dirty, cooked eggs available but no idea how to order them). All little things but other high priced hotels do it much better.",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,3,Terrible decor but helpful staff,"The staff was super friendly and helpful, it was clean and the location is great but the decor of the hotel is horrendous  and rooms are a bit of â€œdumpâ€ with a not-fresh smell. The amount of unmatching, unnecessary decorations gave a claustrophobic feeling to what is a small hotel and same for the rooms. If any advice for them: less is more. Clean up all the terrible decor and the place will be more pleasant.",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Great service!,I decided to book this hotel for my first solo trip abroad and it did not disappoint! It is convenient because it is located near various places in Singapore and a few meters from the train. You can get anywhere in a few minutes. There is a convenience store downstairs for last minute purchases and a hawker center across the street (but I would recommend trying food elsewhere).  The place is beautiful and clean. The facade and room interiors are classic while the lobby is a mix of neo-classic and contemporary. You will always find yourself in the middle of old and new. Their room area is quite spacious too compared to other hotels. The elevator doors are quite slow in opening but you'll be fine. The main revolving door is quite of a work too when I arrived. I'm guessing this isâ€¦,Dec-19,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,Great Boutique Hotel,"The So Sofitel Singapore is an excellent City Hotel. You can walk to the main central Points in Singapore and the MRT is just 5 minutes away. The rooms are nice and beautifully decorated. Breakfast is excellent and the pool is very scenic. Lau Pa Sat is just next door, so you have a vast variety of good Food also outside the Hotel. The only issue is that the AC is set too frigid in the halls. But that is quite typical for Singapore...",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,3 day stay in Singapore awaiting cruise ship,"â€œWhat really made my stay excellent was the way I was treated by Benjamin Penos, the concierge. He really excelled in the hospitality department, and I left feeling that I had made a friend on the other side of the world. I also liked the room, the hotel restaurant, the closeness to Marina Bay area which is truly ""world class"", and the super cool open air festival market which opens every night right next to the hotel. My wife and I loved eating Satay there - flame broiled meat on a stick (prangs, beef, chicken).â€",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Excellent Concierge and overall good service,"Nice hotel and accommodating staff. In particular, I'd like to shoutout Ben at the concierge who went above and beyond to ensure all was well with my luggage, its weight and provided great advice on where I can purchase tokens. I had a few hours before my flight and while sitting in the lobby -- Ben checked in and was ready to get me the taxi to the airport. Really he's a great asset to SO/Sofitel staff.

Staff are friendly and efficient and ready to help.",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Dec-20,5,Artfully Beautiful,Smell of the hotel is so captivating and mesmerising.   Love all the designs and artworks simply beautiful.  The design of the room is pretty especially the ceiling.  The only setback there is no vacuuming of the room during housekeeping hence small pieces of rubbish is not clear properly.  The location is great for foodie like me especially is just next to satay club.  Yes definitely coming back for the experience again and again.  Thanks SO!,Dec-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,4,Wonderful experience,"Had a great stay here for 4 nights - 3 of which were a Luxury Escapes package.

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,Everything was perfect,"From check-in until check-out everything was above expectations.

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Single night of bliss,"First time in Singapore I chose the SO Sofitel for a one night stay. Did the room upgrade package that comes with breakfast and an enormous room. (Huge Bathroom!)  Hotel offers great In- room amenities.  Quality lotions, deluxe shave kits, facial masks, scents to wear, free treats and drinks from the mini fridge, complimentary mobile wifi router (to bring on the go), In-room Ipad for browsing and an awesome Nespresso machine!

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,4,Good Experience,"Same as Hotel Restaurantâ€™s Name, itâ€™s a good Xperience whether room, facilities and foods. Itâ€™s centrally located in the city and next to a food centre selling many local and authentic foods; satay, chicken rice, roti prata just to name a few. Also easily accessible to transport and shopping malls. Most of all, the services provided by following staff were great. They were friendly, accommodating and served with passion and smiles. The only limitation was breakfast were served in ala carte style instead of buffet as to ensure food is cooked fresh and served at the table. Would prefer the latter buffet style as more varieties and desired quantities. In summary, a good experience especially being granted a room upgrade and a simple bread breakfast takeaway for my partner waking upâ€¦",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,Mr & Mrs,"Great place to stay. Very close to all the main tourist attractions. Close to MRT stations and buses. So easy to get around. The hotel itself is beautiful, quality fittings in the rooms, dining, and reception area. All the staff are very polite and friendly especially Ben the head concierge who helped us with hints and good advise on how to get around. The bathroom was a bit small but very well fitted out. Breakfast was great. The happy hour from 5.00pm to 6.00pm was excellent with wine and nibbles. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,2,Below Sofitel Standards,"Poor location of the hotel, hard to reach by taxi due to road closures. Zero service at the entrance of the hotel late at night, appears almost as if closed. No assistance for luggage either. Poor level of service in restaurant for breakfast.",Feb-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,4,Great boutique hotel,"I stayed a couple of nights at SO Sofitel Singapore and in general it was a very nice stay. The design of the room is in a beautiful art deco; the size of the room (SO Urban) is big enough.  Very close to the business district, which it was one of the main reasons to pick this hotel.  I also enjoyed the nice rooftop bar.",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Dec-20,4,Evident of cost savings measures,"It might have been a tough year given Covid-19. The cost saving measures at So Sofitel Singapore is evident. Even their Urban Forest shower amenities are not stocked properly. The hotel is also showing wear and tear. Maybe the staff is shorthanded because we notice blown light bulbs not being replaced. The room was a tad dusty and cleanliness in some ways needs improvements. Only saving grace is the staff are still superb. But, if the hardware is failing and the management keeps on trying to save costs, there is nothing much a good team of staff can do. So, it is a shame.",Dec-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,SO Good,"Great Boutique Hotel. Excellent Location, very close to Bus stops and MRT Underground rail. Walking distance to Merlion Park and Marina Bay. The La Pa Sat Hawker Centre & Satay Club is right at the hotel doorstep. Excellent Staff, all very friendly and helpful.

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,SO/ Sofitel - so good!!,"We are annual visitors to Singapore, and stayed at SO/ Sofitel for the first time this year; booking our accommodation at the last minute. We will definitely be coming back here to stay - the location is excellent, within walking distance to all sites we wanted to visit, the rooms are beautiful with a full, deep bathtub in the So Urban, iPad controls and lovely Lightbox feature/ceiling light, designed by Karl Lagerfeld and the details are superb!  The staff here are lovely, friendly and available to help with any enquiry (no matter how small or random). We were really impressed with Ben and Ismail on the concierge desk, who knew everything (and everyone it seems), their advice and recommendations definitely made our visit a lot more pleasant.",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Incredible!,"Wow! What a gem! The location and staff were faultless. Fazli the bar manager on the rooftop/pool bar is genuinely one of the best guys we've ever met! providing us with so many wonderful local recommendations and generally just being incredible with his service. The room was huge and more than enough for 2 people and breakfast was perfect.   The location is approx 5 min walk from the metro and bus stops all around, walking distance(in our opinion) to Marina Bay and the famous satay street literally on the front doorstep every night.   Couldn't fault this place can't wait to come back!",Dec-19,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Mar-20,5,Great Hotel & Service,"I had a 1N staycation for my birthday at SO/Sofitel and I'm really glad I did!  Firstly, when we were checking in, we were immediately upgraded from a SO Cosy to a SO Studio once the receptionist realised it was my birthday the next day.   All the staff were extremely friendly and pleasant. Major plus.   The room was pretty spacious and had all the amenities you need. The tooms also had toiletries such as complimentary vials of scent and body lotions that smell lovely. I wrote in to the hotel after my stay there to ask if I could purchase these scents but unfortunately I was told they were not for sale.

We were being presented with a bottle of Prosecco on arrival which was delivered to our hotel room and what more a $80 credit dining offered to us for any bill made in the rooftop bar or in the in- house restaurant.

SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,Dreaming of returning!,"This was my third visit to Singapore and the So Sofitel is by far the best hotel I have  stayed at (even better than a previous stay at that very tall, very famous hotel with that insta-famous swimming pool!).  My husband and I had the So Lofty room with balcony (a special treat for my birthday), and my parents had the So Cosy room. Even the smaller room felt larger due  to the high ceilings and decoration. Breakfast was fantastic, the pool my favourite of anywhere I've stayed in Singapore, and the location, across the road from Lau Pa Sat and Satay Street, extremely convenient. The service in the hotel and restaurant was friendly and personal. Special mention to concierge Ben and also the other concierge staff!  Now after trying four different Singapore hotels over the years,â€¦",Jan-20,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Feb-20,5,Brilliant location,A great location for exploring the city. Walking distance to the metro and on the doorstep of the best satay in the city.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful in particular Mazhar who suggested great places to visit and eat.  Complimentary TWG teas and snacks in the room were a treat!  Great use of modern technology with access to all hotel information and room lighting through a tablet.  I did not like the service for ordering eggs at breakfast - having to wait for your eggs to be given to you by a waiter when all other food was available as a buffet. Overall a brilliant experience in September 2018,Sep-19,,
SO/ Singapore Hotel,Jan-20,5,Felt at home,"The location of the hotel is really convenient as it is close to tourist destinations and is very easy to find. The room is quite nice and comfortable. There is an ipad inside the room where you can control the lights, curtains, airconditioning, TV, etc. You can also request a different type of pillow thru this ipad. The room also provides an outdoor wifi which you could take outside, perfect for tourists.  I would like to recommend Ben, one of the concierge personnel who welcomed me when I checked-in.

But it could be best described as spartan, shabby, and uncomfortable. There was virtually no furniture, and certainly, nothing comfortable to sit and relax on. The sofa was cheap, old, and worn.   The king-size bed's mattress was like a hard concrete slab, and we both had a terrible and mostly sleepless night because of that. We got up aching and fatigued the next morning.   We came for a stress-releasing one-night staycation but left more tired than we were when we checked in.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,4,"Great Room, Service Not","Spent a weekend at the Grand Hyatt Singapore. I have a mixed bag of opinions of good and bad of this particular stay.   The Location of Grand Hyatt Singapore is very good, almost at the crossroads of Scotts Road and Orchard Road. The Orchard MRT Station is also just 5 to 8 mins walk. So, you can't find fault with the hotel location.   The Room Type that I booked is very spacious, 2 rooms turned into 1, make it one of the largest in Singapore. 1 side of the room comprises of the living, workstation, the minibar and cabinets to store glasses, cups etc, whereas the other side are the bed, wardrobe and a 4 features luxurious bathroom.   The room is not only spacious, comfortable but they are very practical. I believed the last renovation was done long ago but the maintenance isâ€¦",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Very good Staycation,"Overall Service is great Bfast was great - choose to dine at 10 Scotts as Straits may be crowded  Rooms are clean, corridor bright and clean, Amenities complete I could do an express check out without the need to go via the Reception Counter :)",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,May-20,4,A nice hotel but selection and quality of food is lacking.,"The hotel itself is lovely and the spacious rooms are great. Staff are always happy to help although communication can sometimes be a little challenging, particularly with cleaning staff who do not speak English.   The quality of food is the real disappointment here. Iâ€™m not sure if this is common or if they are just struggling in the current climate. For a five star hotel the options available and the quality of the food being served is a real let down.   Below we have:  - Australian grass fed beef burger - Vegetarian spring rolls  - Season fresh fruit platter  Unfortunately trip advisor wonâ€™t allow me to upload the videos of the chips and the â€˜organic chickenâ€™ which was borderline inedible.   Summary - Beautiful hotel, spacious rooms, great leisure facilities but with foodâ€¦",Apr-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Family friendly hotel,The staff were very helpful and friendly. They are approachable and prompt to the requests i had made during our stay. The rooms are clean and spacious and I love how my kids are able to go on about the room freely,Nov-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Oasis - The Poolside Restaurant is the best kept secret!,"My co-worker and I decided to try the dinner menu at Oasis, the restaurant next to the pool on the 5th level of Grand Hyatt, Orchard Road, Singapore, on a Thursday evening. Jordan and Tango were absolutely delightful in serving our drinks (free flow!) and dinner - from appetiser to main course and dessert - and we had a lovely time. You should check out the place and experience the warm hospitality from Jordan and Tango - Thank you both and your team so much for a lovely pre-TGIF indulgence - prosecco, margarita, white and red wine!! We will be back soon, if not soonest!!",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Excellent Service All-Round,"I stayed in a 2-bedroom apartment. Service before check-in day was fabulous with an email confirmation and a courtesy call.   Check-in was a breeze with excellent service by Katharine.    The food at Straits Kitchen was top-notch although there were a few hiccups with a few forgotten orders. This was understandable as the new norm buffet requires the service staff to be overwhelmed. Kudos to the hardworking staff.   I celebrated my anniversary and was surprised with a cake in my room. And to top it off, we had late check-out at 3pm. Highly recommended.",Nov-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,4,Great stay-cation with room for improvement,"The current stay-cation offer is worth considering, it is a fair value for price option. The rooms are spacious, staff is friendly and restaurant numerous.  But COVID-19 shows its toll: During breakfast, with all the safety-measures in place, we waited - despite reminders - 25 minutes for a watermelon juice. The Damai spa is fantastic (Ms Hien is amazing and a fantastic professional) but understaffed  and appointments are therefore heavily delayed.  We understand that the occupancy during the week might be low and most certainly higher during weekend, but lots of professionals are now available in Singapore, willing to work on hourly/temporary/contract basis!!",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,5,Stay at Grand Hyatt (Grand Deluxe Room),"Check in late at 6pm as there were influx of bookings during the weekend.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,5,Exceeded my expectations,"First off, bravo for honouring corporate rates during the holidays. Most other hotels in Singapore refuse to do this so they can price-gauge their guests because of the season, but the Grand Hyatt did not and that made for an excellent pre-arrival impression; thank you for respecting your guests in this way.  Second, the staff here consistently exceeded my expectations with warm and personable service - something I typically don't find at big properties, especially at full capacity. I called the hotel at 1:00 asking if they could allow an early check-in due to my late booking of a flight from HKG; not only did they answer immediately at such an early hour but they also said they would give me the earliest available room as soon as a guest checked-out and granted me full accessâ€¦",Dec-19,,

Check in very late, check in time 3pm. Can expect to get your room at 430pm.  Check out expected to be on time. They expect it at 12pm. Only 15 mins grace period. No negotiations even though we had 2 toddlers. Need to consider all these with children.  Stayed at level 8. You can hear foot steps of people walking at night above you. Disruption of sleep for my babies.  Depends on what you look for in a hotel stay. If you book during peak period, do we need to expect a drop in customer service ? Cause there are other hotels with good customer service even when they are fully booked.",Dec-20,,

Location wise no doubt there are plenty of shopping to do in around the area, plenty of F&B around too. 7-11 store is just right beside. Breakfast though limited options but nevertheless quite tasty wt the selections offered.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Feb-20,1,Terrible Disappointed,Stayed for 4 nights. After checking I found a letter in my room that the hotel had been contaminated by the Carona Virus and subsequently sterilised. I wrote an email to inform them that the least they could have done was to inform me in advance so then I had a choice on whether to stay with them or not. I got a call saying I was right and that they have started informing guest after my mail.  I have been staying there for many years but will have to reconsider my future plans. Have always enjoyed my previous stays but this time I am terribly disappointed.,Feb-20,,

So unprofessional. Check in by FOBernice, nothing was explained as we book for rate includes few package. No one inform that breakfast and pool needed to book.

Katherine who served my at the Front Desk was very calm and ready to help when I told her I forgot my purse. As it was my daughter's birthday, she gave me a complimentary upgrade to a suite room with a birthday cake sent. The chocolate cake was really yummy. Thank you Katherine, appreciate your kind gesture.  By 3.30pm, we saw long queue for check in. Lucky for us, we got our room key already. Room was pleasant and clean.

Very welcoming to Oasis with a relaxed manner, but at the same time really attentive to food orders and guestsâ€™ needs. Really knows how to put his guests at ease and make them feel at home. The food was prompt and BBQ done to perfection. Often it is the service that is memorable once the food is in the stomach, and this is a case in point.",Jan-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Sep-20,1,Terrible Experience at Mezza 9,My friend and I are Hyatt members for the past 10+years. We made each individual reservation at the counter seat for lunch. But Izan stopped my friend from coming in to sit next to me and also showed a black face claiming to my friend that 2 separate counter seats cannot sit side by side. Why?? We were shocked at the rude treatment. Whatâ€™s the rule of Mezza 9 that cannot allow 2 individual Hyatt members to sit next to each other at the counter bar? The counter is so empty. Why is there such bad customer service in the first place? Why canâ€™t they arrange if there are empty seats? Itâ€™s simple and basic customer service. My friend and I felt insulted as if we are eating free lunch . Very disappointed in their service today.,Sep-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,5,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel.  The rooms are a bit tired now, but they are roomy and comfortable.  I understand that a major renovation is in the works, but the property is so busy now, it's hard to see how Hyatt can close it, even partially.  Anyway, the staff is great, very friendly and efficient, and the food and beverage facilities are outstanding, unmatched in Singapore I think.  Also, a terrific location, just off Orchard Road.

We were greeted by name at the front door where our temperatures were taken, and we were advised what precautions were in place at the hotel for COVID, which was thorough and appreciated. Every experience was perfect they were amazing, we ended having to spend an extra 2 nights and they continued to look after us.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,1,Great Location - poor service and below average facilities (rather dated),The location was great. However the overall service received from the front desk to house keeping was poor.  The rooms were dated and the facilities for were well below the expected standards of a five star establishment. The general areas including the lifts showed neglect.  Old and unclean carpets and a poor smell through the air-conditioning system.  The standards for hygiene and cleanliness was well below acceptable standards.  House keeping had not changed the dirty linen or made up the room to an acceptable standard.  The curtains were not drawn and the room remained untidy.,Dec-19,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,2,Under Staffed during Busy Holidays,"I have been in and out of this hotel for many many years. Our trip was 27 to 31/Dec. I know it was during the super busy period. But the hotel certainly did not give it's customer discounts, so why should we expect anything less??? The hotel staff was very good to email us ahead of our arrival to check and confirm about our arrival time. BUT, our room was not ready till 8PM!!! so, that's the point of the email before???

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Sep-20,2,Quite disappointing,"Booked a premium deluxe with club facilities. Room is well sized but furniture is outdated and oldish looking. Bec of restrictions, the lounge is located at the annex of mezza9. There is nothing much inside but good snacks served 6-8. The pool is small. Breakfast at straits kitchen is pretty bad. Afternoon tea at 10 Scotts was my highlight for the day. Overall the service provided by Mai and Isaac was excellent but the others I met were clearly frustrated as they were overwhelmed by the crowd and expectations. Hotel should consider updating and upgrading. A bit of disappointed overall as the minuses were more than the positives.",Sep-20,,

Let me first share the good points. Firstly the place is very well located, its in the heart of oxford street. There are plenty of malls and eateries around. The room itself is decent and spacious. The people at the reception are helpful and helped me check in early. This is where the good part ends.  I will elaborate the issues now. Firstly their swimming pool is overall average.

Room is really spacious, and even though we only took the deluxe king room category, there is a common area. This can only be seen in suites for other hotels, so they are really generous with space.  2. The location is perfect, with malls surrounding you in the heart of Orchard Road. We even went for cheap manicures at far east plaza.  3. Front desk service was really nice and personable. They also gave us a cake for our birthdays.   Cons:  Nothing to fault the hotel really.

I was extremely happy with our rooms which was upgraded, which was much appreciated.  The service person Royston was extremely helpful and welcoming. The team at The concierge were also very helpful and willing to go that extra mile to help you. The Hotel itself very comfortable, clean and pristine.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,5,One of the best stays I've had...,"I've been fortunate to travel many countries around the world. This was one of the best experiences. From the staff, to the facilities, to the room including the in room dining was great. I stayed there for a week with my parents and all of us were very unanimous with this memorable experience. There are numerous instances of excellent customer service by the hotel staff throughout the stay. Our requests were promptly addressed at any time of the day or night. Kudos to the management! We will gladly recommend and return again when the opportunity arises.",Jan-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,1,"Late Checkin , staff were not meticulous",Not worth the rating. Can find better hotel options around the orchard belt. Poor service recovery and staff lack initiative to pacify guests especially at the Club lounge.Try waiting for 2.5 hours and your service staff donâ€™t even bother to offer us any food. Awful experience.,Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Average service,"Rooms : generous in space . We got the deluxe room deal and very happy with the space. However, the twin room we booked had a cigarette stench and we found some cigarette leaves at the sofa. The king room toilet have a stench that seems like coming from the drainage system. Guess the property is old. But overall the room is nice and very worth the price.  Service : something that really need to work on. Maybe iâ€™m spoiled by the ihg groups services. But i was really expecting a warm welcome from the staff. But the service is really very dead. I would describe like you buy something from the supermarket. Donâ€™t expect those 5 star services, itâ€™s more like a 3 star service. The only cheery staff is probably the guy who passed us the ice bucket. Other then that, they all look veryâ€¦",Nov-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Oct-20,2,Disappointing experience from a reputable brand,I booked 4 nights at this hotel Iâ€™m a Hyatt member and stay in a lot of Hyatt properties each year. The hotel is very good but a little old and tired. The condition is probably better than youâ€™d expect for an hotel of this age. The hotel is stunning food options are vast and thereâ€™s great eating options for all. The buffet restaurant is highly recommended. The bakery has lovely sweet gifts.   My only concern with this hotel was that I originally booked for 4 nights but needed to add an extra night as my work required me to stay an extra night. Despite the huge size of the hotel And my being a Hyatt member I got a very cold NO from the reception and they told me I had to take my stuff and leave the hotel as the check out time. I felt they could have made an effort to accommodateâ€¦,Nov-19,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Sep-20,4,Suitable nothing amazing,I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a reasonable stay in Singapore with a nice comfortable hotel. It is definitely not incredible but is enough for a family stay in Singapore. The breakfast buffet is large and very good along with the dinner and nice bar with a happy hour. We were a little displeased with the breakfast ( the fruit was frozen ) and inedible. Aside from this room service was just enough and the reception was helpful and kind to my kids. The pool is relatively small with many kids around but you really dont go to the Hyatt for the pool so this didnâ€™t bother us. Overall a good stay and would recommend it.,Sep-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,5,Old charm in heart of Orchard Road,"Hotel is situated in the heart of the shopping district. Everything is within walking distance, otherwise buses and train lines are just next to your doorstep.  Hotel staff are helpful and attentive, speedy check in and check out.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,4,Staycation at Grand Hyatt,"Hotel was very clean and comfy. The staff were very friendly and provide excellent service. The only issue was that the checking in was a bit slow due to the overwhelming queue and we had to wait in line for quite a long time. That being said, this caused a congestion at the reception area. More seating area should be allocated at another area in the hotel for waiting guests",Nov-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,3,Time travel back to 1990.,"Basic room amenities like good WIFI/Smart TV is lacking.  Room service doesn't even have coffee/tea. Strange.

We were pleasantly surprise with the upgrade to the Deluxe room as the room was spacious and clean, with a separate living room space. Enjoyed the Balmain bath amenities and large bathtub as well. Great health checks and hand sanitizers provided at all corners.   Most staff that we met were friendly and helpful. Would have given this review 5 stars except we came across a rude and unwelcoming staff (short-haired Filipina lady wearing blue fitness attire) at the reception of the spa/gym and that completely ruined our otherwise perfect stay.

Toiletries (despite the brand name; Balmain) seemed low quality and watery. The gym is also disappointingly limited in space and full of old equipment.   Hotel is very conveniently located along orchard road and lots of shopping and food options nearby. So overall still a great stay!",Jan-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,4,Delightful Stay,Overall good experience. Staff were accommodating to requests.breakfast served at straits kitchen was excellent but maybe alternate menu would be better.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,1,Worst Check-in Experience in a purported 5* hotel,"Turned up at official check-in time of 3pm. Made to wait almost 3 hours before I got the room keys. No apologies or compensation, and zero service-recovery attempt. There needs to be an option for negative rating for such horrific service, especially at a purported 5* hotel.  The only redeeming value was the spacious suite room, which showed its age in some aspects with the last renovation more than a decade past.",Dec-20,,

The room we stayed in was a Junior Suite which was good too because the bathroom was huge and the living area was nice.  Minus points The hotel is rather dated.

Cons: 1) Probably one off issue, the room had electrical issues. What seems like a switch and lighting problem may possibly be wiring problem. It's not so much of the problem itself but the sense of security that there may be an underlying safety concern should it be a wiring issues.

Check in service: confused F&B: Spoiled items (milk) at the breakfast buffet. Rooms: 1) bathroom: the water in the shower ranges from luke-warn to steaming hot in less than a second leaving your skin burned unless you are a fast jumper. 2) The comode misses the top cover plate, so it is always open and available to you :(  The hotel had low occupancy, in fact it was empty, and even at this level the service completely missed the markâ€¦",Feb-20,,

We had booked a twin room for 3 person and were upgraded to a junior suite at check-in.  For World of Hyatt members, download the App for easy check-in/out and request for amenities",Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Feb-20,5,"wonderful, as expected","The Grand Hyatt Singapore didnâ€™t disappoint. Iâ€™ve been to many Hyatt around the world and the Grand Hyatts in Asia are by far the best in terms of cleanliness, service, and guests being made to feel cherished. Kids loved the pool. Location was convenient for walking to hotspots. Would love to visit again.",Dec-19,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,5,Awesome staycation,"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt.  All the service staff that I had contact with were all very friendly, professional and efficient.  I love the option of online check in. I opted for early check in knowing that it may not be possible to check in early due to availbility and I was pleasantly surprised when I received an email notification that my room was ready before my selected time.  Even though there was a queue during check in, I was served rather quickly. I also love that there is an option for express check out, a very friendly staff assisted us when we enquire about the express check out process which was a breeze.  We had to make pool and breakfast reservation prior to our stay which was easily made from the email I received from the hotel.  We loved the room.â€¦",Dec-20,,

All of us a well (which is noteworthy given the timing of our stay and the dates in the reports that have come out about this hotel) and very well taken care of by the team working in this hotel.   The hotel is currently running a fantastic deal for guests who book a room with Club access. Club guests, apart from a fantastic FULL breakfast buffet at the famous Straits Kitchen restaurant, can, during happy hour choose from a full menu of drinks at the Martini Bar at Mezze9 together with its full menu of accompanying food and snacks. After drinks, Club guests can choose to have dinner at the Straits Kitchen restaurant (full menu options) or at the poolside restaurant.   I am a Globalistâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,4,Good experience,"It was overall a pleasant stay at the hotel. However, I wished that the toilet cubicle area had a drainage hole as it could get clogged up with water. Furthermore, I felt that the toilet was not well-ventilated which made it smell bad after a few uses. Not sure if it is the same for other hotels, but our trash were not thrown out when we requested them to be disposed at night. Instead, they gave us trash bags (when we had already packed them in plastic bags). Perhaps they could improve on the trash disposal system part as it can affect the guest's overall experience in the room.",Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,3,Dissapointment with hotel handling,"Have just spend 45 minutes queueing in the lobby to check in. Was informed that check in starts from 3pm but saw the snaking queue much earlier.   Finally when it was our turn to do the check in around 3.45pm we were informed the rooms are not ready and to come back in 2 hours! And best part, check out will still be at 12 the next day.   It was supposed to be a joyous occasion as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary as well as hubby's birthday but it became a horrible day.   I understand that it is the covid period and us Singaporeans are making use of the 100 voucher. But the hotel should have anticipate the crowd and managed their rooms better.   Upon conveying my disappointment, they gave us a room on the 5th floor facing another building and said that's the best theyâ€¦",Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,"A clean, fun & hospitable stay","This was our 2nd stay in 2 months. Like our previous stay, Grand Hyatt did not fail us in their service & hospitality.

We all enjoyed the pool especially. Keep up the great work!",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,5,Impeccable service at Hyatt,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt recently to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were gifted with cakes, chocolates and an extra bed for our kid. We were touched by the attention to details ie we are Muslims and the chocolates were non-alcholohic.   The staff were attentive and responsive. They followed up with phone calls and tv message to inquire abt our well being.   Breakfast at Straits Kitchen was good. The options were not as varied as a buffet but the food was still of reasonable quality. We could order as many servings as we wanted and were served at our tables due to safe distancing measures. Even when it was busy, the staff always seemed to know what they were doing and were still attentive to our needs.   The impeccable service at Hyatt sets itself apart from other hotels. â€¦",Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,3,Not as what I expected,"Room is clean and big enough for couple stay . Receptionist not very friendly when I asked for direction. Check in staff was nice and helpful. Breakfast was delicious but disappointed dinner at Peteâ€™s restaurant , the staff was a bit rude and rush when taking our order, and most of the food are too salty .",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,2,Dissappointing!,"First of all, we waited in queue for 1h30mins to check in. Nobody came and explained to us the situation, nobody offered any drinks or even bottled water, nobody offered to help with our bags. We were all just standing in line for 1h 30 mins.  When I finally reached the counter, I was told my room w a bathtub was not ready and they upgraded me to a suite which i appreciated BUT check out time was still going to be 12pm. That was utterly ridiculous because it was 4:30pm by then.  I had to argue with the receptionist who then gave me a check out at 1pm, which I still found unacceptable. I demanded to check out at 2pm in which she told me its not fair for the guests checking in the next day.   So was it fair that I was only going to be in my room at 5pm?   The swimming pools wereâ€¦",Dec-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Oct-20,5,Pretty much the perfect hotel,"Booked Hyatt mainly because of Straits Kitchen but was blown away as the service, amenities and overall stay experience were top class.  I shared with the hotel that the purpose of the stay was to celebrate an anniversary and they made the celebration so much sweeter by upgrading the room and giving us a delicious cake. The cake was really delicious; we were more excited about the cake than the room upgrade (jk).  We were not expecting this at all; thank you to all the staff at Hyatt for giving us such a great experience.   The only downside to the stay was the buffet breakfast that wasnâ€™t a buffet; due to the ongoing COVID restrictions. Food was still delicious, though.  Will definitely return and keep telling anyone who would listen that Hyatt is the best hotel in town. Greatâ€¦",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Feb-20,1,Ionizing Machine - Contravirus?,"Upon checking into my room, I was greeted by an ionizing machine (see picture). After some quick Google research on the purpose of these devices, ionizing machines are used for air purification - i.e. the previous guest must have created a mess before my arrival.  How disappointing to find this machine RUNNING in my room upon check in! The property should have at least had the decency of REMOVING the machine before I checked in..., I would have never known.   To do this to a Hyatt Globalist member (or any guest) is extremely disrespectful. Repeated calls/messages to the manager on duty went unanswered. No apology was offered by the GH during my stay, even after waiting 2 hours for a 'clean' room.  Time to stay at the JW Marriott next door - goodbye GH S'pore!",Dec-19,,

It was only found when I almost finished the food. Imagine how disgusted! It was a black pinkie size insect which was apparently cooked and dried. I reported to Hyatt immediately and someone named Charles called me the next day to tell me they would processed a full refund. However, 2 days later he called me again and told me with a very tone from the first time he called me that they could only do a 30% refund and warned me NEA is aware of the case so between the lines he was trying to we donâ€™t care because NEA doesnâ€™t care so now we donâ€™t want to refund you full already!

We booked this hotel as the rates were so much better than the rest of the hotels at the Orchard Road vicinity. I didn't had very high expectations of this hotel as it is quite and old hotel but I was pleasantly surprised with their rooms which I think was renovated recently. I booked the junior suite and it was spacious for 2 persons. They had balmain bath products which was a wonderful surprise. We used their valet and also their pressing services and I can say that the staffs was very efficient. Room service food was delicious and it may be on a pricey side but hey, its not every week you go for a staycation.  I love their breakfast and would highly recommend it. Eventhoughâ€¦",Nov-20,,

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Jan-20,4,Family Friendly,"We were 4 adults and two small children. Catherine (front desk) who was wonderful, arranged for two adjoining rooms with living rooms. She also was able to check us in early which was great since we had been flying for 24hrs. The rooms were clean and well maintained by housekeeping. It is an older hotel but they keep it clean and in working order. The location is very convenient to MRT and many malls that have great food courts for young families that are looking for casual atmosphere. The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food options and the staff, although very busy, made us feel welcome every morning. Catherine also made note that our last day was our granddaughter's 3rd birthday. The staff brought a small cake to our table to celebrate. It was a thoughtful touch.â€¦",Jan-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Nov-20,5,Great stay at Grand Hyatt,"Booked a much needed getaway at Grand Hyatt for a 1 night stay and got my room upgraded with early check-in. Room was super spacious and I enjoyed my stay there with my other half. Customer service was great and the staff even remembered my earlier request regarding my membership details. Breakfast could be better IMO - food wasnâ€™t particularly tasty. Itâ€™s nice that everyone is allocated a specific time slot and area to dine so there is no crowding. Location is great since itâ€™s a stone throw away from the Orchard shopping belt. But do expect a crowd in Nov and Dec as it is the school holidays and everyoneâ€™s shopping, so you might feel a tab overwhelmed at times. Overall would recommend for anyone whoâ€™s looking for a staycation for families or couples retreat!",Nov-20,,
Grand Hyatt Singapore,Oct-20,1,Worst Experience from a Global Brand,I had the worst and most frustrating experience dealing with the team and that started way before in the reservation process. The hotel outsources all  reservations to their central team and with many different rates and promotions now locally in Singapore this can get quite confusing.  I had made a package deal that was promised upon the call  that the rate included breakfast and dinner. The reservation was made and it was confirmed to my Hyatt registered email.  I received a change email from Hyatt ( not even a personal email or a notification) just a template change email and i had to hunt to find out that my dinner was removed. I called the hotel and spoke to the manager only to realise that the rate was a weekday rate and dinner was not included.  I had forwarded theâ€¦,Oct-20,,

Food was not bad though selections was limited and service standard may not be the same before COVID-19 situation.  All went on well until settling for bill. My card was charged $243.34 when there was only 2 of us dining  at $80 plus per pax. The service crew explained that he was distracted and used my card to charge the bill for the 3 ladies besides us, when there were only 2 tables at the section where we were seated.

Grand Hyatt Singapore,Dec-20,5,Lovely surprise!,"We were so pleasantly surprised by how huge the room was and the fact that we got a connecting room too. Also received a complimentary birthday cake which was SUPER good + halal! :) The rooms are equipped with luxury bathroom amenities and had separate spaces for a cubicle, shower and bath. To note: toilets do not have a lock, if youâ€™re staying in a group. This was fine for us though! The food at Straits Kitchen was superb - wonderful ambience but at the moment service might be a little slow-paced due to the absence of buffet spread (we have to wait to be attended too, thank you to the staff for being patient with diners!).",Dec-20,,

In the online check in, it was said the staff may come around to check my details so I expected to be given the room first. Early check in was granted but I wasnâ€™t able to make use of it as I was out doing errands unfortunately. The lady doing my check in kept saying her system was slow and kept us waiting.

It was partition into 2 areas. Living room and bedroom, a roller bed was provided so that my daughter had her bed to sleep. However, there is a common flaw in a lot of older hotel that i visited.

Her friendliness and willingness to go the extra mile to check on a room with a high floor is most appreciated.  We took the package for an upgrade to the King Bed Deluxe Room with breakfast. Pleasantly surprised by how huge the room is. It has a living room area with comfortable sofa and a working desk. The bedroom is huge as well with a comfortable bed and a bathroom with bathtub. Breakfast is at the Straits Kitchen which tends to get crowded around 9am onwards...the spread is the same daily.

The staff at the front desk were super friendly and accommodating, helping us with all our requests and questions.  We both took tue/wed off work, and because it was midweek we had the entire pool to ourselves both days (no restrictions or time limits).

From the beginning - luggage took nearly an hour to be brought upstairs to our room - would have been quicker doing this myself.  WiFi constantly cuts off - even though this is meant to be premium fast. Does not stay connected.  The lifts have the most irritating and annoying bell ringing noises Everytime they are approaching.  The food for breakfast is not great - no flavour or taste. I have travelled to many places and stayed in 3 star properties with better and tastier food choices.  The executive lounge on floor 31 is boring and basic, very small and limited breakfast choice here as well as the afternoon tea - you are better off at Oscars. Flat atmosphere. â€¦",Jan-20,,

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Nice to be back,"I have had the pleasure to stay here many times. Itâ€™s a great hotel with excellent hospitality. Location is good close to Marina Bay and short transfer to Changi airport. The only comment would be that pool area needs a facelift, a bit sterile compared to the hotel at large.   This time guest service was tested after a bad luck experience, but management handled it in a very kind and professional way.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,3,5-Star Hotel without Sauna and Steam Facilities,We check-in Conrad Centennial Singapore because we are unable to travel abroad to use our reward points due to COVID-19. But we are very much disappointed that the so-called 5-star hotel does not have Sauna and Steam facilites for hotel guests.,Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Conrad Singapore = Happy with Refurbished Rooms,"We stayed at Conrad Singapore a few years ago and eventually moved our stays to Fairmont back when rooms at Conrad were starting to age and when Fairmont had generous Platinum suite upgrades.  However the situation has changed: there are no longer Fairmont suite upgrade certificates now that Fairmont is under Accor, Fairmont has become stingy regarding upgrades even with guests with a lot more stays than us, no lounge access, no breakfast, and now itâ€™s Fairmont which is starting to show its age.  Meanwhile rooms at Conrad were renovated a couple of years ago.  Despite this I was in the mood for trying something new for example Andaz Singapore but when looking at prices I realized that Conrad was nearly unbeatable so I booked there and did not regret it.    In our room uponâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,3,Management need to focus more,"Chose this hotel for a staycation based on a circular from Hilton Honours advising of its reopening. As my account manager at American Express had just been changed so I chose to book by booking dot com.   Lots of problems in this respect - absolutely no respect for Hilton Honours Diamond card if you book via any app apparently, despite it being the same price as Amex.   Interestingly no H Honours designated check in - I was told to join the back of the general queue. Went to the bar to wait a while until the queue were less. So I eventually got to check in. I had received a call from the reservations manager a few days earlier acknowledging my Diamond status and reminding me there were restrictions in place re the afternoon tea and happy hour. At check in I was told there wereâ€¦",Dec-20,,

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Gin experience,"We go around Singapore bars in pursuit for the best places for a couple of exploratory drinks concortions.   Lemuel Abatayo expounded the gospel of gin and tonic in Conrad Lobby Lounge. His recommendation brought forth the taste of juniper, botanical, asian and flora notes in one experience. It was truly a gin experience here, he is friendly and seek to understand your preference. If you are looking for a change from the usual drinks you are having, I will recommend to look for him in Conrad.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,5,LOVELY HOTEL,"I stayed here on last Dec 2019, this hotel is so lovely. I get the nice view from my room and the room was so comfy. I love the conrad teddy & the duck rubber in the bathroom :). Even though the corridor looks old but the room looks good. The breakfast was okay, for me just need more selection - 2 days with the same bfast a lil bit boring. The queue in the resto was long but the have a back up and offer to have breakfast in the lobby lounge - but the food not much as in the resto. The location is perfect, close to everywhere and also the station.  I definitely will came back if the situation back to normal.",Jan-20,,

I used to stay at other nearby hotels, but the Conrad is just plain better, largely due to the great staff.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Apr-20,5,"Great stay, great rooms, great views and great location","We love Hiltons and from the lobby and bar to the rooms and Hiltonhonors club, this was an amazing hotel.  The reason we picked it was convenience to every thing, Marina Bay, Colonial Quarter, Singapore River and two subway routes.  Transportation was incredible.   What we did not expect was an simply awesome view of the city from our room and one of the best Hiltonhonors club rooms.  We had a great and incredible breakfast each morning.  The staff was top notch.  Finally, I loved the gin Old Fashions at the bar.  You get the big ice cube with a Conrad hotel stamp, very cool.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,3,Christmas @ Conrad,"Hotel is very nicely decorated for Christmas however it feels like lacking of the Christmas mood and feeling that the hotel used to have.   First night was not so pleasant as there are something like water droplets sound that could be heard outside the window which is not raining at all and we find it spooky and requested for a change room   Some of the USB Charging port couldn't be function properly and lack of small plates, cutlery and dustin in the room.   Overall Experience would be great if it wasn't caused by the discomfort experienced.",Dec-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Staycation with family,"We stay in 25th Dec and Super enjoyed our stay. Check in agent was friendly, knowledgeable and she give room with Super view. Hotel lobby was decorated for the theme. We were given complimentary access to the club lounge on 31th floor. As always club lounge service was outstanding and we enjoyed the food presentation. I would recommend this hotel to all my friend and family. Location close to train station and to office tower and most importantly shopping center.",Dec-19,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,"Still our ""go to"" place in Singapore","4th visit here, love the refurb. Great pool area, Dali is just the best pool attendant.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Relax in elegance,"The feeling of luxury, elegant ambiance, friendly & helpful staff who do everything to cater for the needs of the guest.

Excellent location, close to sightseeing venues, shops, transport & amenities.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jun-20,5,Fantastic Conrad,Always stay on the 31st floor.GM behind the scenes runs a slick ship and walks the talk. Not sure if he has retired now?  Golden Preony best Chinese in Singapore.  Girlie is non one on the executive floor,Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Class & Style in Singapore!,"The Conrad is the epitome of luxury and further promotes the allure of Singapore. From the time you arrive, you are treated as royalty with the lush accommodations. The staff is amazing with providing superb customer service. As a Diamond Member, it further proves our loyalty to the Hilton Brand. The accommodations are first class and we look forward to our next visit to Singapore!",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Sep-20,5,Oscars ala carte buffet,"2nd time in a week. Awesome food and service food. Crew : Sherman, melody, daniel, Dave, James and the chef and others.   All well dressed smart and fast and smiling even  with mask on.   Thumbs up. N keep up the good job",Sep-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,5,Birthday Staycation,"Had a birthday staycation with the family for 2 nights. Service was impeccable, with seamless check in as well as check out! Room was nice especially with a view by the city. I would like to compliment the staff especially Agnes and Fatimah who served us during our check in and check out. However, I was quite bummed out as the swimming pool needs to be booked and I could not have my preferred timing during my stay. Breakfast at Oscar's was amazing and my son really loved the fish congee! Overall, the stay was great, friendly staffs from the belldesk, concierge, to the front desk. Thank you!",Dec-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,4,Executive,Stayed in a Executive King Suite on the 30th floor for a leisure stay.  Found the room nice with great views & check in + staff were efficient but no wow factor or any interactions that exceeded my expectations. The Exec lounge reminded me of an airport lounge so atmosphere is quite businesslike & found cocktail (for evening canapÃ©s) selection & breakfast average. It's a busy hotel in a good location but would try another property next time,Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Almost perfect!!!,"The hotel is world class except for the swimming pool. We were surprised how dated the pool was. With Singapore's weather, it would have been nice to relax at a state of the art swimming pool. But everything else in this hotel is superb!",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Amazing stay,"Stayed in conrad for 4 nights and it was truly fantastic. Much has been commented on the dated interior decor of the hotel, but while it is certainly not the newest, I didnâ€™t find much of an issue with it. The other elements of our experience certainly more than compensated for it- as a Diamond member, the staff went the extra mile to upgrade us to a suite, which was truly unbelievable. At the Club lounge, we were also given a welcome glass of PJ Champagne which made for a nice touch. Service across the board for any guest was excellent and I highly recommend it",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,5,"First review, third stay so far I think ðŸ¤”","Interestingly weâ€™ve never reviewed this establishment before. Probably because it was a come and go situation. Usually for work.  For our latest stay, we decided to relax and try to use the pool or have a late breakfast @ Oscars. We did just that except that the pool was full of people lounging, and swimming. Oh well, decided not to dip after all.   Buffet breakfast usual variety. Happy with good coffee and eggs.   The best part is of course the service. From the concierge to the executive floor and to the gym, all were ðŸ˜Š smile-y and ready to greet you and just well, being friendly and helpful.   Will be back again Conrad. Keep up the good service - 5 â­ï¸ s !",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,All great,Quite big hotel with both leisure and business travel. Not very personal atmosphere but all was fine and spotless. We didnâ€™t feel any crowds or line for breakfast and lounge as in many of the other reviews. Great room. Location super. Will for sure use this hotel next time in Singapore,Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,4,Excellent stay,Very good experience. Extremely kind and helpful personnel. All details were taken care of. Excellent location to go walking to major attractions at the bay. Close to all kind of restaurants with a wide range of prices,Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Luxury and service,"This hotel had amazing service and accommodated our 3 year old boy. The room was modern clean and large. Well appointed and had perfect aircon. I love a soft bed, while these beds were not the softest they were very close and you had a choice of 14 different pillows. Breakfast had a large choice and freshly made bread. Overall I would be happy to come back anytime.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,great hotel with great view,"the hotel is close to marina bay park, and very close to metro station. The view in our room is also very good, we can see the national stadium. there are many choices in the breakfast, the only thing can be improved is they can provide laksa at their noodle counter.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Beautiful,Great hotel and friendly staff. The beds were super comfortable and room included breakfast.  Cappuccinos were on point and a huge breakfast selection. Near the MRT a very walkable location.  Worth the price.,Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Good stay,This is the second time I am staying in this property. And I would stay their standard is service is impeccable. The rooms are well proportioned. The staff is helpful though I arrived quite early in the morning I was provided early check in. Very well located close to MRT. Have a excellent breakfast spread but they need to include more veg options,Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,2,A hotel devoid of customer service,"There were too many individual issues to list here.  Suffice it to say, if you are looking for a good location for a conference or similar, this is your hotel.  If you are expecting a Conrad level experience go elsewhere, this is a poor example if the brand.  Troubles started at check in and didnâ€™t end Eve through checkout.  For S$300-400/ night there are much better options in Singapore.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Great executive lounge,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel in February. The executive room was well appointed with stunning views. The executive lounge in this hotel was excellent. The staff were very attentive and all of the service offerings were excellent.   Breakfast selection in the lounge is understandably limited. The huge range of choices available in the main restaurant was impressive.   Although the hotel is more formal and corporate than others we looked at (we were on holiday), we were not disappointed with our choice and would highly recommend this hotel to both leisure and business travellers - particularly if you have access to either of the lounges.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Simply the best hotel for a stay in Singapore,"From the chauffered airport pickup to the afternoon tea in the executive lounge - the Conrad Centennial Singapore was perfect.  As a Diamond member, I stay at a number of Hilton properties across the world and this is one of my favorites.  My only criticism and this is understandable due to space constraints, the outdoor pool is smaller than I would like; however, very large for the property.",Aug-19,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,"Classy, Comfortable, Clean. Top in Singapore","Understated elegance permeates this well kept and professionally run property.  The staff  is warm, welcoming and eager to please. The service is attentive. The property is spotless clean.  Service in the pool area is attentive and always present.  During my trip to Singapore I have changed 4 hotels:  Grand Hyatt (Corona virus spread at the Property) and the service is nothing less than appalling! JW Marriott: run by millennials. Another Bonvoy disappointment. Raffles: the train has left the station a long time ago! Form over substance, words over facts. Finally the Conrad does not disappoint.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,4,Great stay!,We stayed over the weekend and the service was great.The receptionist was professional and friendly. The experience was fantastic. My kids love it. The bed was soft and comfy. Wifi logged in without any issues. Ample charging ports near beds which is a plus points!,Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Super comfortable hotel; But....,"This is a super comfortable hotel: Large beds, large well-equipped bathroom and possibly the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in.  In addition, the in-house breakfast and buffet dinners are fantastic. A wide choice, and great staff.  The pool is small, but adequate. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance.  The only ""but""...... Make sure to book a taxi to the airport in advance. The hotel is in an area that does not get passing taxis. Use this tip, and everything else will be great.  Another tip: Look out for Flash Hilton Sales. Big savings can be made.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Nice family stay!,"We travel with a toddler and they are very nice to upgrade us to a suite, which is really helpful when you had a active toddler, we also got a bear and a bath duck toy, our little guy love them!  Breakfast is awesome and service is also excellent, when the table is ready the high chair is also there.  Location is also good, close to everything except the zoo. Subway is also close by.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and would like to come back.",Jan-20,,

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Excellent stay,"Stayed 4 nights in a room on the executive level. We loved it so much we cancelled the hotel we had booked for a stopover later in the week, and rebooked Conrad Centennial! Clean and spacious rooms. Easy walk to attractions and the metro. Staff are amazing, no request is too much trouble. We had a medical emergency with my son and Joanna on the front desk made sure we got the help needed.  We are looking forward to our next stay!",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Singapore,Stayed here the beginning of January for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were large and had wonderful amenities.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Wedding and extended stay,"Wifey and I just had our wedding at Conrad last week and also extended our stay. Ms Crescent Lim & Mr Ali Shamsudeen were really committed in ensuring that our wedding programme proceeded smoothly and were dedicated in making us feel comfortable throughout our stay. Even when there were last min changes in the planning, Ali and the team made it happen. The suite itself was also amazing and clean, and the pavilion ballroom wedding was a dream come true. We appreciate all the hotel staff for their dedicated service and would definitely return again!",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,"5th Stay, Great location to explore the city","On the last visit, we were upgraded to a corner room facing the Merlion. Executive Lounge was good and had LP champagne, not something that was previously available. Dining at Golden Peony for the dim sums is a must for us each stay. Overall, service is good but can be improved. Still a hit-or-miss for us.",Feb-19,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,You can't beat perfection!,"From the warm, friendly, professional and efficient welcome to the excellent service throughout our stay, this hotel is faultless. We have stayed in this hotel many, many times and it never disappoints. The rooms are superbly comfortable, in room amenities are excellent and the room is tidied again at the evening turn down service. The pool area is calm, peaceful and wonderful for relaxation, as are the 2 ( yes 2) executive lounges. This hotel consistently meets the high standards it sets itself, and so it is an absolute pleasure for us to look forward to our arrival every time - and our stay here - and that's why we keep returning. After all, you can't beat perfection! Thank you to all of the staff and management for looking after us so well and for making our stay soâ€¦",Jan-20,,

All the staff are extremely friendly.   Super recommended.",Dec-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Happy! Happy!,We couldnâ€™t be happier with our 5 nights at the Conrad Centennial.  We were upgraded to a lovely spacious comfortable room on the 31st floor overlooking the Fountain of Wealth and conveniently located next to the Executive Lounge.  The lounge had lovely afternoon tea and evening cocktails with plenty of food selections.  There was also breakfast though we chose to go to Oscars instead where the buffet was extensive. The pool was lovely and someone always came around with iced water whenever we arrived.  The gym had everything one needed for a good workout.  The hotel is extremely well situated near several shopping centers and restaurants.  It is a 2 minute walk to the Promenade MRT station.  We loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again when in Singapore.,Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Nov-20,5,Wedding Banquet,"Hold my wedding banquet on 15Nov2020 during COVID19 situation. Everything runs smoothly with the help of the crews and team from Conrad Hotel. They are very helpful and make sure that everything will goes smoothly. Crescent who is our wedding coordinator helped us alot during this period of time, as there are many changes and uncertainty.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Top notch in every way,"We stayed here for three nights before a cruise and will be back for one night Post Cruise.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,family time,"We have Hilton Honors membership, diamond level. Booked 2 connected rooms for family vacations. Centrally located, right inside SunTech commercial area where there are malls surrounding by the hotel within walking distance. Many choices for food and shopping. Check in process was quite and simple, i arrived very late at night. Service is good as expected for Conrad. We did use the 31st floor lounge for breakfast, felt very cramped and service is ok, not the best, could improve. There is also another lounge on the 4th floor too, service is so so.....We then start dining on the 1st floor buffet for breakfast. Much more options and service is also great, it was very busy.

Big shout out to Janeth in the breakfast restaurant, she took good care of us and kept me topped up with coffee. The food in Oscars is fantastic and the areas are perfect. The Conrad is in a great position for most of the MRT. You can access most of the city with little changes. The marina bay gardens are just amazing and the tree display at 7.45 and 8.45 each evening is well worth a visit or two. Marina Bay Sand shopping centre is great and has a great food court. The fountain light display at 8pm and 9pm should not be missed.  Singapore is a city for anyone who loves to shop. There are malls all over.  Resorts world is easily accessible where again there are many shops and alsoâ€¦",Jan-20,,

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent Price for Luxury,"I stayed for 3 nights here in January on an Amex FHR stay. The price was phenomenal for what you get. The breakfast spread at both Oscar's and the Lounge by the Pool were excellent. Every staff I interacted with, from the front desk to the concierge, to housekeeping were incredibly helpful and friendly. You don't get the absolute best views from the hotel, but I didn't come to Singapore to look outside of my hotel window. It is fairly conveniently located as well.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Oct-20,5,Wedding banquet,"Crescent was our main contact for the overall wedding banquet. It was an unusual time and we had to change our plans numerous times with every covid development. Thanks to Crescent for always being eager to give us the best out of every circumstance.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Fantastic anniversary stay,"Wife and I had an anniversay staycation at this hotel where we held our wedding 3 years ago. The hotel had a heart shape flower arrangement on our bed for our special day, and also complimentary chocolates! Bonus is the famous Conrad bear plush and rubber duckie which we took home. As it was Xmas season, the gift shop was made of edible gingerbread that smells really fragrant and tempting to eat. The lobby decor gives a warm fuzzy Xmas vibe.  Comfortable stay and fantastic service! Highly recommended for a great getaway.",Dec-19,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Great hotel and location,"We had a wonderful stay at the Conrad Centennial. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the staff was very helpful. The food at the breakfast buffet is really good, with a mix of Western and local dishes. We went on the early side which I recommend as when we left there was a wait to get in. The hotel is in a great location, central and walking distance to Gardens by the Bay, the Esplanade, and Kampong Glam. Overall we really enjoyed the hotel and would definitely stay there again.",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Nov-20,5,Wedding Banquet,"Kudos to the Conrad team for organizing the wedding banquet!   Crescent, our sales manager, was very prompt in her replies, efficient and meticulous. We felt that we were in very safe hands leading up to the wedding. The personal touch was commendable!  Imran, our assigned banquet manager, along with the rest of the banquet team was very professional, ensured our needs were met and that the banquet was a success. Top notch service and lovely experience having them run the show!  The food/catering by Golden Peony was amazing and our guests were full of praises. Absolutely delicious. Best banquet menu ever!

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,4,Excellent location for Hilton Loyalists,"I visited the property at the beginning of the year. As a Hilton Diamond, upon check in was upgraded to a room with a view. Upon entering the room saw we were given our bottles of water, a Conrad bear and a nice set of chocolates. The room was well appointed however despite requesting a non-smoking room there was a faint smell of smoke in the room.  Also, the small round table in front of the tv is awkwardly place. The bathroom was very nice and modern. Despite some small complaints, the room was overall nice and as expected from a Conrad.  I visited the pool as well which was not crowded and a decent size.  As a Hilton Diamond, breakfast and lounge access were included. Everyday we ate at Oscar's for breakfast. On each day of my stay, the place was quite crowded. I would adviseâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent and Top notch service,"My husband and I had our wedding last weekend. Conrad hotel was the first hotel that we did site visit and we booked it immediately. Itâ€™s one of the best decisions made cause we are being assisted by a great team of people.   Our wedding coordinator, Crescent was really helpful, problem solver and efficient. Without her assurance and assistance on every little detail on our wedding planning since day 1, it would not be so well planned and coordinated.   Banquet food was fabulous and we have received great feedback from the guests.   Lastly, we will like to thank banquet manager, Aripin and all the servers that afternoon for their team work and service.   I will definitely recommend this wonderful team and place to any couple.   Thank you so much for everything!",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Nov-20,4,Nice and strategically located hotel,"We stayed in this hotel in January 2020 for seven nights. I choose the hotel based on my previous experience with Conrad hotels. Furthermore, I am a gold member with H.H. The hotel obviously is not brand new and you can notice some aging processes affecting the hotel. Our room is of adequate size and has all the amenities that you need. The room and the bathroom are very clean and I enjoyed the scent of the toiletry provided. Our room has a reasonable view of Marina Bay. The check-in and check-out were smooth.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent hotel well located in downtown area,"Conrad is the upmarket arm of Hilton Hotels and this Conrad is no exception. High rise hotel with picture windows on the executive floor. Spacious rooms with plenty of furniture and fittings. Excellent bathroom with a separate shower. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Access to Executive lounge is with executive floor key. The lounge is rather strange but also interesting as instead of a large room there are a number of smaller and more intimate rooms. Buffet breakfast is all right with adequate selection but the main breakfast room has more choices. Peony restaurant has excellent Chinese cuisine, well presented and delicious.",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,4,Christmas with Friends and Family,"We stayed at the Conrad for 6 nights with another family in connecting rooms, the children had a great time and even though the hotel were quite busy during the festive season, they tried to accommodation most of our request in a timely manner. Very nice touch to include the Christmas bear and duck toys for the kids. Given we had booked via Amex FHR program, fresh fruits and amenities were replenished regularly and we used the dinning credits for in room service, food was fantastic and amongst the best in room meals weâ€™ve had. In term of breakfast, both the Executive Lounge and Oscarâ€™s offer a wide selection of international cuisine and made to order dishes, services are prompt and they try to look after the young ones.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Review of my Wedding Banquet on 15/02/2020,"My Fiance and I chose Conrad Centennial Singapore to hold our wedding banquet and holy matrimony ceremony. We decided on the pavilion ballroom to hold our lunch banquet, and we did not regret it. The hall was spectacular, and its made of glass so ample light could come into the room. Our guests were all very impressed by the elegance of the venue.  My fiance and I want to give a big thank you to Crescent, our catering sales manager. She was very professional and efficient in coordinating our wedding. Thanks to Crescent, everything from the food tasting to banquet hall decoration to room arrangement and payments went perfectly well.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Luxurious Hotel Stay in Singapore,"The service and quality at the Conrad Singapore was incredible! The room and amenities were very nice, and their â€œGin oâ€™Clockâ€ happy hour for gin/tonic was tasty and cost-effective. The breakfast buffet was one of the best hotel buffets we have ever had. They also left us a great welcome box with local-flavored crisps and soda. We booked through AmEx FHR, and we received so many additional perks - including 1 free night, daily laundry credit, and a credit to use at the lounge, which we redeemed for afternoon tea. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for our last 2 nights. While, the access to rooftop pool was nice, we enjoyed the comforts of our stay at the Conrad much more.",Jan-20,,

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,1,Who writes these reviews!,"Expect queues for breakfast. Stuffy boring atmosphere in executive lounge. Lack of service  by staff at restaurants. Oh and if youâ€™ve booked the luxury escapes offer, then expect a really low quality and small portion of food for your free set menu 5 course dinner at peony.Not worth the price you pay. Staff rude and inattentive. For a five star hotel it really is no more than a 3 star.  Lifts slow and limited. Rooms are nice but room service is limited. They wonâ€™t replace tea bags.  Oh and although it says you can have 3 items cleaned, what they really mean is you get a light press.  Really dull surroundings and atmosphere.",Jan-20,,

From the moment we arrived the staff were amazingly helpful and always went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed. Our room on the 28th floor was large  and had a spectacular view of the Marina Bay area. The bed was so comfortable. The room had everything we needed for our stay and was spotlessly clean The hotel was elegant with many lounge areas. We had booked with luxury escapes and had the benefit of using the executive lounge. The afternoon tea and evening dishes were very tasty.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Convenient location in Singapore,"Our cruise ship disembarked in Singapore last December.  We took the MRT train from Marina South Pier to the Promenade station where Conrad Centennial was located.  Having the MRT station nearby was very convenient.   We got there before 11 AM and were pleasantly surprised that they allowed my husband and me to check-in early!  Since we were staying only for one night, the early check-in allowed us to start our adventure right away.   Our room was on the 15th floor and it was very spacious and well appointed.  We found a bowl of fresh fruits as well as two bottles of water on the table.  The roomâ€™s large windows faced the Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City across the street.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,4,Good decision!,"We stayed at the Conrad because this is where my husband is always billeted when heâ€™s in Singapore for work. He told me that he was pleasantly surprised when a couple of the staff at the lounge greeted him warmly. (Not a surprise that they were Filipino). It was my first time there and the experience was pleasant and memorable. The room was good-sized, smelled good and well appointed. I like that they had a Nespresso machine. There were complete amenities and everything was clean and orderly.  The lobby is beautiful, even more so with the Christmas decor.   We stayed there with two other friends and they too were quite happy with the accommodations. We also liked that there were good restaurants close by.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,Outstanding Service at Conrad,"We stayed at the Conrad Hotel the night before leaving on a cruise out of Singapore. We really appreciated being upgraded to a suite as a result of our diamond status with Hilton. The breakfast at Oscars was more than delicious, with so many local and distant flavors.  However, one of the best parts of our experience came after our cruise. We got off the boat early one morning, and our flight back to the US was it until after midnight. So, we went back to the hotel without a reservation, and not only did they store our bags for the entire day, but late that evening they allowed us to shower in the spa facility before heading back to the airport.

The rooms are very spacious, comfortable, have a lovely bathroom with a great shower, are cleaned and re-stocked with toiletries morning and evening.  There are two executive lounges, one on level 31 and the other on level 4, where the pool is situated.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,5,Luxurious stay,"We just stayed 3 nights in the Conrad via Amex FHR. The staff were all lovely and very attentive, especially in the restaurant Oscar where we had daily breakfast and did the Sunday brunch. Breakfast is varied but somehow we still felt it lacked a bit. However, the staff was constantly refilling items and constantly approaching us for drinks. The Sunday seafood brunch was incredible! You can eat hours if you wish of different seafood all good quality. It was the highlight of our stay. We had a premium room which was large with a nice large bathroom and a nice view.

Ai Ling from Reservations, promptly called to confirm on some details and then offered us a generous early check in and late check out times. Very much appreciated!  Our rooms were spacious and cozy with a kidsâ€™ tepee + their amenities.

Is there really space for two people in the bathroom and luggage in the room.  Size of the room is 40sqm which allows this.  There are so many things to try at breakfast.  We both want different things to eat and luckily the variation is huge.  Very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent.

Due to the current low occupancy, the check in staff readily gave us early check in and late checkout which was much appreciated. The quality of the room was outstanding. Even the basic room here feels like a mini suite in other hotels. I especially enjoy their bathroom amenities, the Shanghai Tang toiletries in particular are really high quality. The bed was especially comfortable. Some hotel beds feel impossible to fall asleep on. This was the complete opposite... it felt impossible NOT to fall asleep on. Fantastic quality. The breakfast was also impressive. It was not as substantial as other luxury hotels but certainly the quality was there. We feel like returning again soon, really enjoyedâ€¦",Feb-20,,

In addition to the benefits we received with our room and our credit card program, we received a cake, wine, and a bed decorated with petals in the shape of a heart. My husband and I were constantly blown away by the care and attentiveness of the staff and the quality of the hotel as a whole. Any requests that we made were promptly taken care of.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,1,Underwhelming Experience,"It was a good experience here until our moments were ruined by the hotel staff. We were confronted by the assistant manager informing us that we are not allowed to have 4 people in the room.  She threatened to bring up the security guard with an aggressive stance and tone when we have tried to explain things nicely on our end. She even threatened to check the cctv which does not affect us in any way because we were honest when she asked how many of us were there. It was our friend's birthday and we planned this surprise for her.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,3,Canâ€™t meet my needs unfortunately,"The room is great, the staff is great.  Unfortunately I have a garlic and onion allergy and all the food is pre-made.   So would be nice if the chefs would at least offer to do the same things requested but without garlic and onion. To make it from scratch... but nope.   Itâ€™s highly unfortunate that so called 5 star hotels that cost hundreds per night canâ€™t attempt to meet even basic needs of guests.  The general manager sent a nice welcome letter to my room and the staff is great. Except at the retaursnt when the waiter is asking the Indian food chef, the chef looked so pissed. I donâ€™t want that cooking for me anyway.  Amex is once again the MVP for me to give 100 free food credit so at least I can live on fries and cake at the hotel on that.

Having last stayed here two years ago (and several times before) it was heartwarming to get such a warm and genuine welcome back from Michelle who heads the Executive Lounges and from her wonderful colleagues Gurley and Mark who are super people who combine great friendliness with amazing attentiveness.  I should also mention Sami who quietly and efficiently was on hand at breakfast each morning.  The room on floor 29 was extremely comfortable and quiet.  The wonton soup on the seats outside Oscars makes for a great lunch.  The Golden Peony restaurant provides genuine Chinese fare and we were grateful to our waitress for making recommendations.

They also delivered a small cake to us in our room, which was a really pleasant, unexpected surprise! The cake was delicious too, which made us feel their staff really went beyond. The room is spacious and clean plus the bed is comfortable too. View is great, facing marina bay sands! Bathroom amenities could be better though (they only gave 1 set of toothbrush and toothpaste when staying for 2 people). Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a staycation!",Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Apr-20,5,Our Perfect Wedding at Conrad Centennial Singapore,"A big thanks to Ms. Crescent Lim, F&B and Banquet team for making our wedding day smooth and wonderful.  Crescent has fulfilled all of our request from discussion on wedding package, follow by food tasting, planning on precautionary measures during Covid-19, to check-in hotel room on actual day, follow by tea ceremony in the function room, to wedding reception and lunch and during our 3D2N stay. Only one word to describe, ""Excellent""! Everyone who attended to us were helpful and friendly, food was great and surrounded atmosphere was cozy. My husband and I would strongly recommend Conrad Centennial Singapore if you plan to have a wedding banquet. Look for Crescent :) as she will do her best to make things happen for you.",Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,5,Great location. Fantastic hotel,"The excellent sized rooms are spotlessly clean, the views from the very large windows are breathtaking whichever side you are on, the toiletries are quality products. Showers have a good pressure of water and the separate bath is glorious to soak in at the end of a long humid day of walking. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance to Raffles and Chijmes, and is a pleasant 35 min walk to Orchard Rd.  Weâ€™ve stayed here before and we will do so again.",Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Feb-20,5,Best lunch buffet in Singapore,"It was amazing lunch at Oscars!  Coming from the other side of the world (USA) this experience at Conrad Singapore is really praiseworthy.  Me and my husband appreciated everything, very friendly service and the foods are really superb.  Weâ€™ve got to try a lot of Asian dishes, rich in flavors and we really enjoyed each and every bite.

Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,A lovely hotel in a great location,"I really can't fault the hotel in any way.  It has a particular charm, the staff are really attentive, it's in a handy location (not far from Marina Bay Sands), has an MRT station next door, is opposite shopping centres, and a perfect launching pad for a few nights exploring Singapore.  I would've loved it if they had a jacuzzi, but that's not a criticism.  The beds are probably the best hotel beds I've ever slept on and I prefer them to my own bed at home!!  The room service food was really good and well presented.  The stand-out feature though was the hotel's ability to handle breakfast seamlessly despite us staying over XMAS and tending to go for breakfast at peak time each morning.

The room was very clean, spacious, with many modern cons, large comfortable bed and a huge smart TV, electric curtains and blinds, lovely views. The bathroom was large and clean. The entire hotel looked pristine and clean. The executive lounge was beautiful. It is cleverly positioned on the corner of the hotel which means you get a different view from each window. Cocktails from 1800-2000, good selection of dishes hot and cold, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks.

Banquet food was also fabulous and we received many positive feedbacks from the guest.   Lastly, we would like to thank Sethu, our banquet manager and his team. He was always around whenever we needed help. He's also very attentive towards us and the guest, you can rest assured that everything will run smoothly with him and his team around.   Overall, we're glad we chose Conrad to host our wedding! It's one of the best decision made because we are being assisted with a great team of people.",Oct-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Mar-20,4,Decent stay!,"Good location and attentive staff; however, the spa needs major improvement - especially when taking into account the prices being charged for each service. It just did not feel luxurious enough. The level of service offered could easily have been provided in a regular 4-star hotel.",Mar-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jun-20,5,What a Location!,"What can I say other than a truly 5 star experience. From Check In to Check Out we had a fabulous time. We upgraded to Executive level and were allocted a fine room. We could have Breakfast in three locations and the Lounges ajacent to the pool and on the top floor were both excellent. Praise must be given to the Conrad Team at this location, always ready to help with a cheery disposition. A special mention must go out to Peng Yee who looked after us extreamely well in the top floor executive lounge! If we are ever back in Singapore we will make sure we stay at the Conrad which is ideally positioned near the Marina Bay area, which we found preferential to the shopping are in the centre of the city! Try the Pina Colada Slushy in the hotel bar!",Jan-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Apr-20,4,Excellent accomodation but club lounge below par,"We stayed a few days as a stopover on our way to New-Zealand. Our Marina Bay view room was on the 24th floor with access to the executive lounge on the 31st floor. Our room and bathroom were perfect with limited traffic noise, it did not affect our night sleep. The 20 meter outdoor pool was perfect for a swim. The lounge however was below par. The canapes served in the lounge were not tasty at all, they were usually preparations of chicken; the desserts were greasy (hence our median rating of ""Service""). We had our daily buffet breakfast in Oscar's. Some breakfast items in Oscar's were relatively limited, e.g. fresh fruits except when you like melon; there was some choice of dairy products. We are not sure whether there was a larger choice of Asian breakfast items. Therefore,â€¦",Feb-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Dec-20,5,Pampered 3 days 2 nights,"Did a family staycation at Conrad from 21 to 23 Dec and it was the best decision made. We feel pampered every time we stay at this hotel. The rooms are nice and comfortable, the staff are attentive and always add a smile to their service, and we are able to easily travel around the Bay Area and shopping belt. We took the family package this time and were spoilt rotten with the late check-out, complimentary extra room and satisfying breakfasts. Special mentions to the crew at Oscarâ€™s (especially Berry Chua and Carol Loy) for making the (served) breakfast buffet as fuss-free as possible. I believe even the management came down to support during this trying period. Most staff members wear a smile even though it must have been very tiring for them. After all, the same staff we sawâ€¦",Dec-20,,

The hotel is well maintained, strategically located in the heart of the city, room at level 23 enjoyed unbeatable view of Singapore landmark buildings, Suntec is just across the road.   Service was wonderful and room is kids friendly and family friendly.   Absolutely delightful stay with Conrad and hope to be back to the high floor room next time.",Dec-20,,
Conrad Centennial Singapore,Jan-20,5,"The location is better for business travel than for a vacation, but the luxuriousness and amazing brunch were amazing","We arrived to the Conrad after 2 weeks on a medical mission boat around the Atolls of Papua New Guinea, so anything with hot shower would have seemed luxurious to us.  Each day was even better than the last.  Everything was perfect. The views from our room were amazing. The brunch offered something from several nations.....all delicious. We caught the 1:30 am flight out of Singapore and were permitted to return late in the evening to use a room take a shower and change for the flight.  The staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable.",Aug-19,,
Regent Singapore,Mar-20,5,Amazing Service,"Spent my husband's leap year birthday at the regent and it was fantastic. We first went for high tea at the tea lounge, which had a wide spread of items from the classic scones and clotted cream to premium dishes like roasted wagyu beef and salmon confit. Other desserts like macarons, Victoria sponge and Eton Mess were also a lovely surprise. What I was most impressed with though, was the service. The servers kindly briefed us on how everything worked upon learning that it was our first time there, remembered to remind us that we had another round of tea/coffee we could order, and even offered us complimentary parking at the end of our meal.  After the wonderful meal, Cindy the receptionist helped check us into our hotel room. She was friendly, efficient and extremely helpful with our requests. Upon entering the room, we were greeted with decorative balloons, a complimentary dessert and a letter from the GM wishing my husband a happy birthday (it was wet ink signed too, which was a nice personal touch). And the dessert did not taste at all like a commercially produced ""free"" dessert, it was an absolutely decadent chocolate mousse with a light and moist sponge centre. Delicious.  Other points to note: The room was very clean, bed was extremely comfortable, 2 power sockets on each side of the bed, good supply of hot water, and also our room service order came with complimentary artisinal bread and butter.  DEFINITELY will be back. Will probably bring my mother here for her birthday next ðŸ˜Šâ€¦",Feb-20,Travelled as a couple,
Regent Singapore,Feb-20,5,Wonderful place to stay in Singapore,"This is an outstanding hotel with exceptional people who really care about their guests.  I have stayed there many times and I would never choose any other hotel in Singapore. From the moment I arrive, they look after me like I am family.  I have never seen a hotel where all the staff truly enjoys making their guests as happy and comfortable as possible.    When I check in, the doorman greet me by name and are always ready to help me. The room service people even remember my favorites and often surprise me with little extra things that I didn't expect.  Even the housekeepers make me feel like I am someone special.    The rooms are awesome and newly renovated with a huge TV and very comfortable beds and furniture. From the restaurants to the gym, all the facilities are great. The Manhattan bar is the best in Asia and probably one of the top bars in the world with a comfortable feel and an extensive list of cocktails  and great food.    My favorite part of the hotel  is the Regent Club where the staff all treat me like a VIP (even though I'm nobody special).  Every single one of them has taken the time to get to know me and make me feel welcome.  I can't count the number of times that they just did nice things for me without me even asking.  You don't often find this kind of sincere care for guests in most hotels even if they a lot more expensive.   The location of the hotel is near to Orchard Road, the Botanical Gardens, Tanglin Mall, Holland Village and other areas of Singapore and is very convenient to get to.  A bus service stops right in front of the hotel and there is easy access to public transit or taxis when you need them. It is close enough to Orchard Road but far enough away that you won't have to deal with the traffic.    Overall you won't find a better place to stay when in Singapore. You can find many hotels in Singapore that are more expensive but they just can't measure up to the experience you will get because of the Regent's people.  Book a room on the club level and you won't be disappointed. They will spoil you and you won't want to leave. This is definitely my favorite place to stay in SE Asia.â€¦",Jan-20,Travelled on business,

Regent Singapore,Mar-20,5,"Great service, wonderful hospitality","Dined at Summer Palace two weeks back. Would like to drop an appreciation to the doormen at Regent Singapore. I think they are the most under appreciated staff that people seldom give recognition. I was with my grandmother and she have trouble walking. He came over by the side, opened the car door and helped my grandmother out to the lobby. I was just amazed at his enthusiasm on doing his job well although something that seemed trivial to everyone. It is this small little act of sincerity, that restored faith in humanity that we are beings that can show kindness to one another. We cannot express how pleased we are with the outstanding hospitality your hotel provides and this small act became a sharing story for the night to our fellow diners throughout dinner.",Mar-20,,
Regent Singapore,Mar-20,5,Service makes the difference,"It sounds a kind of oldfashioned, but I must confess, although the hotel is not the most modern or updated one, it is by far the best service I ever got in a hotel, not only in Singapore but also globally (maybe One & Only and Ritz Carlton at the executive lounge are similar to it).  I have been to Singapore a number of times in the last 7-8 years, such as Ritz Carlton, Sands, Marriott, Grand Hyatt. But the staff at Regent was just amazing. Everybody knows your name immediately (from doorman to club lounge staff) and we got offerend a grand suite with about 90 sqm, with two bathrooms, TV in each room, dining table with orchids, spaceous and cosy sitting room, L`Occitaine amenities, Nespresso machine, free Perrier and Evian water, a welcome fruit platter etc. So nothing toâ€¦",Mar-20,,

Regent Singapore,Jan-20,5,New Yearâ€™s stay,"Before I review the room, Iâ€™d first like to thank all the staff for making us feel extremely welcome since the moment we arrived. The service was fantastic and all the staff were very friendly!   The room too was fantastic. We booked a family suite so it was very spacious. The kids loved being able to sleep in a tent (although it was a bit cramped for two kids and one ended up on the floor half way through the night...she ended up sleeping with us).   The hotel feels old though and it lacks the modern feel that I think many of the other hotels of this class offers. However, the rooms were clean, bed extremely comfortable (as were the pillows you can choose to your own taste), the amenities great and the service as good as you will find in any hotel. For this reason, if I haveâ€¦",Jan-20,,

It really felt special as Singapore does not have lots of dog friendly places. Also special thanks to Diana at the front desk who helped us to check in. She was absolutely amazing, very warm and friendly, making sure that we have everything we needed for the staycation.

I quite enjoyed the elevators, seeing the design of the hotel from the inside was very fascinating. The room was nice, although it overlooked a construction site at the time of visiting.

He was very patient even though we had lots of questions! Apple took over when Andy was on leave and she did a good job too. We enjoyed ourselves very much during the wedding. But one thing to improve was the food. We opt to change some Western dishes to Chinese dishes. The Chilli Crab with Mantou was a let down, my guests feedback there were no crabs, just a pot of chilli sauce. First serving of the Cod was well executed, but subsequent servings were not as good. But otherwise, it was all good. Suite provided is very spacious and clean, enough to house 3 women to do their makeup and also other family members to rest. Overall itâ€¦",Nov-19,,

The Front Desk agent even gave us 2 bottles of water when she found out we just came from a long flight. All the other interactions we've had at The Regent Club Lounge, the Fitness Center and at the Concierge were equally very pleasant.     The staff were all so pleasant and greeted you with a smile!

I overheard a diner talking about a availability of a online promotion of 45$ per person. I asked and was kind of disappointed when told that I should book 2 hours before lunch.

Regent Singapore,Jul-20,5,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"I was here at the Tea Lounge of the Regent Hotel Singapore.  This is one of the few restaurants that has consistently maintained its high standards of food, service and hospitality.   Given that its post circuit breaker, the buffet was served at the table. Table service was fast, effective and there were enough staff on hand to help keep us guests feeling comfortable. In fact I kind of like this new way of conducting the buffet.  For food, I think the pics speak volumes for themselves. The new gryphon tea selection is not bad actually even though I tend to be more TWG leaning. The milky oolong is goes well with the roast beef while the lapsang souchong pairs well with the dessert for a smoky finish. It was delicious.",Jul-20,,
Regent Singapore,Jan-20,5,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location, Great food","This is a gem of a hotel.  Staff were great.  The room was very comfortable and the breakfast buffet was simply the best around.  Conveniently located near the top of Orchard Road.  This was a grand hotel in the 80s that is showing its age only because of the architecture.  It is kind of ""High Anxiety"" with a huge central atrium and all rooms surrounding the atrium.  But though the architecture is a little dated, the hotel has been maintained in perfect condition.  It looks like it was recently updated with new furnishings and fixtures.  Importantly the room was immaculate, the beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms was phenomenal with multiple shower heads and highest quality personal hygiene supplies.  The staff were SO NICE and helpful.  Really loved my stay at thisâ€¦",Dec-19,,
Regent Singapore,Jan-20,5,Coming home to The Regent,"I have just returned from a 4 day business trip to Singapore and felt compelled to write to you to commend you and your team at Regent Singapore.  Regent has always been our preferred choice on our visits to Singapore over the last 30 years.Despite it being an older establishment,the personalized service and warmth of the people who have looked after this property over the years have served to keep it on top of its competition.  This trip was a little different for me, as there seemed to be an under supply of hotel rooms in downtown Singapore(with almost all hotels being overbooked including Regent)resulting in my having to book an unknown hotel on Rocher for two nights.  It was a mistake but I had little choice.After a night I cut my stay short and forfeited one nightâ€™s stay. â€¦",Jan-20,,
"voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel",Dec-20,5,A wonderful staycation at the Hilton!  Will do it again!,"The Hilton is one of those brand names in the hotel industry with a long tradition that you know will always not disappoint.  I have been to the Hilton for various events in the past, but never as a guest.  This staycation would be my first time staying at this property, and, boy, it was a great experience.  Now, its always good to know that the building has been around since 1970!  So of course from the outside it looks dated and old fashioned compared to the other newer sparkling hotels.  But once you get past the staid facade, that is where the magic begins.  The property has gone through several rounds of renovation and upgrading, and the lobby is a shining example.  The layout is spacious, bright and welcoming, unlike the property at my previous staycation.  The check-in was deliberate, as per SafeSG guidelines, but it was never inefficient.  Only the necessary information was transacted between the guest and the staff.  From the moment we stepped into the lobby, to queuing up, and entering our room, we took just slightly more than 30 mins.  There was no unnecessary time wasted on waiting for something or somebody.  The room was, as expected, your standard hotel room, not fantastically big, but spacious enough for us to put our luggage and other stuff.  Beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was a bit too cramped for my liking, but its not a deal-breaker.  The gym and swimming pool are located on the 23rd storey, and you will need to go up there to make your reservation with the kindly old gent manning the counter.  The pool area offers a spectacular view of the Orchard Road area, so bring your phone along, especially during the evening.  Pool towels are 'free flow' from the cupboard, and fresh ones are regularly placed.  You will need to reserve your breakfast timeslot when you check in, because this is a really popular location.  We booked the early timeslot of 8.15am, and the cafe was not filled, so the service crew was able to attend to our needs.  The breakfast menu is available via QR code.  The crowd starts coming in from 9am, and that is when the staff gets a little frazzled.  If I may give some advice to the Hilton, it would be to hire more service crew now that buffet service is replaced by table service.  It was a little difficult to get refills for coffee, tea, danish and even bread when the staff are so busy running around table to table.  This is no fault of their own because of SafeSG.  I can see the staff doing their best in a challenging environment.  And that is my review of the Hilton.  If the opportunity arises, I'll be there again.â€¦",Dec-20,,

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Family Friendly Staycation,"Before the Arrival, the hotel do require all the guests particulars for easier check in. We have 3 rooms in total and all rooms were ready when we arrive in the afternoon towards the check in time at 3pm. We were also placed all on the same floor and despite being on the 10th floor, the view towards the city is a beau.   During the stay, everything was good. There was no flaws in terms of service and room condition overall. Everything is in working order and housekeeping did a tremendous good job overall in cleaning the room during make up. My niece and nephew were also given kids amenities in the room such as bathrobes, toothbrush, slippers, toothpaste and even the bath gel.   Facilities wise, both pool areas are good. Well maintained swimming pools and the staffs attended offered towels and cold bottled water. The rooftop pool for kids also have some kids amenities to use like the floats and of course the view above is a beau at sunset.  Checkout was smooth and was lucky and nice enough for us to enjoy a little more time in the room as we were given a later checkout.   All the staffs from the reception to the concierge as well as housekeeping were all friendly. Even our food deliveries were send up without having the drivers to call us. A shoutout to one staff named Azmi for the smooth check in with the small tokens for my niece and nephew, checking on our stay when we approach the next day and the handwritten note for the late checkout.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Best Staycation Ever,"2nd time staying here with my family, and I must say that their service standards is one of the tops amongst other local hotels. Check-in was a breeze, where we were attended to by Ms Miku, a friendly and welcoming lady. We were welcomed by a tray of yummy nonya kuehs and some snacks for the kids in our room, and a handwritten note to welcome us back to Four Seasons. We also encountered other friendly staff who made our stay welcoming - from the hotel lobby, to the poolside and even for room services. Thank you to Mr Jumain who humorously welcomed us as a fellow Liverpool FC supporter. We encountered a faulty bar fridge in our room, which was promptly tested and swapped out with a new fridge by their technician (sorry, we did not catch his name) so that we could enjoy our chilled drinks. Housekeeping was also accommodating to our preferred timings, as we could inform them when we would be out so that they can make up the room. It was efficiently done during the hour when we went up to the poolside. At the poolside, guests were provided with towels, cut fruits (and jellies for kids), chilled mineral water and even tubes of sunscreen to protect our skin. Yes, this is their standard level of service provided to all guests by the pool. The check-out was also quick and efficient, thanks to Ms Shereen.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Exquisite hospitality!,"We visited Singapore to celebrate my daughterâ€™s and husbandâ€™s double birthday. As we always prefer to stay at Four Seasons, we booked here. Their concept of hospitality is miles ahead every other brand. We were given an amazing room at the 18th floor and when we arrived everything was ready without even requesting for an early check in- the hotel was full due to Chinese New Year (early check in at 12:30pm). A great surprise was there for the birthday people as well (check fotos attached). The view was amazing, the bathroom was amazing, the ambience was fresh and clean.  Breakfast was complete and I still cannot forget those divine cranberry muffins. We also had dinner at One Ninety once. The food was good but what I have to say is that we ordered plain kids spaghetti with parmesan on the side for our daughter and the portion was insanely small. We had to make an additional order as the amount served was ok for an infant rather than a kid (12$ each order). This was the only detail we would have pointed out regarding our dining experience here. Other than that, room service was fast and delicious. We ordered pizza, club sandwich, lemongrass ice cream and a divine apple pie! Also my husband took a 90mins massage at the spa and he really enjoyed it. I am pregnant so could not follow him. Next time :). The hotel is conveniently located right close to the shopping district and also within walking distance to the Botanical Garden and short driving distance to Sentosa island.  4 days were not enough for us! We will be back for sure! Keep up the amazing work Four Seasons! â€¦",Jan-20,Travelled with family,

I came for lunch at the hotel and the car park area was overflowing - not the usual. It was difficult to even manoeuvre the narrow space. My first encounter was with Raj, a staff from The Capitol Kempinski, who very patiently explained to me that (just like he was doing to the all impatient drivers) the situation and finding them alternative places or park.  Very patient indeed - not the usual.   Then came Joshua Chan - probably Rajâ€™s senior - who then did his best to help me find a narrow area for me to park my car safely - instead is just waving me off to park in some remote area.

Fariha then showed us to our room, and gave us a tour of the beautiful room.

Mind you, this lobby lounge doubled as the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE.  2) My truffle fries was served up in an unremarkable platter -- it had not a single condiment to accompany it until I asked for it - no mayo, no nothing. Really not up to mark at all.  3) service standards, albeit more attentive than some other awful 5-star establishments, however, needs more than a touch of earnestness - service like you mean it.

The hotel is relatively new, after years of painful and careful restoration to return to its former glory. The building facade is spectacular, and the hotel is brand new with a modern twist.

It gave a very palace-ly vibe for the stay. With unique sliding doors, the good use of space felt more spacious than it would have been if each 'room' was done traditionally. Despite staying right next to the main road in a civic district, the walls were well-insulated that the traffic was not audible, and had a good rest there.

Hotel is in the perfect location close to public transport and multiple attractions/ malls. Breakfast incredible! So much variety including a lot of the street food you find around Singapore (Nasi Lemak, Kaya Toast etc)",Dec-19,,
The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,4,First Class,"A wonderful stay with top notch service. The room was big and the breakfast was sumptuous. The other downside is the internet service which is average at best and not able to connect to the WIFI on your laptop. You will have to call in to get them to enable your MAC address. Even then, the connection was poor and intermittent. Was not able to do work efficiently. Response can be slow during their peak period where it seems that they have a lack of staff as there are times when you dial the guest service, and no one picks up the phone despite calling several times. Otherwise, a beautiful place to relax.",Dec-20,,
The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Superb!,"This hotel is wonderful. Everything is five star. The service is impeccable, the furnishings and decor are beautiful and the atmosphere lends to a sophisticated hum that settles you the moment you enter.  Angel on front desk was so very hospitable and YK in the executive lounge could not do enough to ensure our stay exceeded expectations. All staff met us with a smile and a polite enquiry as to what they could do to enhance the moment.  Centrally located, this hotel ticks all the boxes.",Jan-20,,
The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,One of the best,"There are hotels and hotels. After a while they look the same.  But the Capitol Kempinski stands out because of the character of its decor, its rigorous standards of cleanliness and standard of excellence in service.   The room I stayed in had beautiful high ceilings and tasteful decor. The bed was very comfortable and bedlinen of high quality. The bathroom was spacious and luxurious.   The balcony was spacious and was near a traffic junction. Yet strangely the city traffic sounds were muted and this place was like an oasis in the city centre.  Service was prompt friendly and very professional. The food was excellent and creative. A wonderful team of people.  I highly recommend this beautiful hotel. I know I will miss staying there. Keep up the good work!",Sep-20,,

The service was top-notch, from managerial staff to service level staff. We received this service be it at the front lobby, the gym, the Swimming pool/spa, even most of Housekeeping staff, well enhanced by the staff at the Executive Lounge, the two Joseph(s) and Lihana(I hope I spelt it right, due to my unwillingness of wearing my glasses).

With toiletries being sent 5 hours later and having hair found in the food for their in room dining, even having â€œwheel-tracksâ€ appear on the ipad screen after turndown service. All the manager said was that nothing of such has happened in their hotel, and they have no idea of how it happened. So basically they are saying that i did all of that to my own stuff? Horrible experience...",Apr-20,,

The room was meticulously appointed, as would be expected, but that is really just the start of the experience. Management shows great initiative bu pre-empting the desires of its guests, from small touches like remembering favourite seats in the restaurant to providing goodies from the mini bar at no charge.   This is a special hotel that makes its guests feel more than just lucky to be staying at such a place, but as members of its family for however long this happens to be your home.

Lovely room and the TV in front of the bathtub is a bonus.   However the TV channel selection is rather woeful, only a handful of Chinese channels & no BBC or HGTV, which was rather disappointing.   We enjoyed the breakfast provided buffet ala carte style - I had the prawn noodle daily! Dinner at La Scala was unfortunately mediocre.  Had 2 unpleasant encounters - on the first morning when we went for breakfast, the receptionist mentioned that someone bearing my last name & my room number had already had breakfast earlier that morning.

Appreciate that this is still being done despite the covid situation. Also Stella has a high attention to detail, she noticed my passing comment about the construction noise and made it a point to inform me about the construction on my second visit, which is appreciated.  Angel's cheerful disposition made a great impression, and my wife commented that her spirits were lifted as well from interacting with Angel.

The hotel staffs were all extremely helpful and polite. Whenever you walk passed them, they would smile at you. The bed was so comfortable! The room was quiet and we can't even hear the cars because apparently the windows are all three layers! They even prepared a cake and balloons as I was there during my birthday. The room was cozy and the washroom was huge! Also the breakfast was so yummy! We had lunch and dinner at the burger place and Thai restaurant at Capitol too and the food was so good too!

Due to the growing coronavirus situation in Singapore, Royal Caribbean cancelled the cruise altogether.  As a result, I requested that the hotel refund my pre-paid rate.  United reached out to The Capitol Kempinski Hotel in Singapore, but they refused a refund.  The JW Marriott in Singapore as well as The W Hotel in Hong Kong both graciously refunded my miles, despite the non-refundable rate as it was a situation  completely out of my control.  I travel to Singapore frequently and was looking forward to trying The Capitol Kempinski.  Based on this experience of customer service, I don't really have much interest any longer.",Feb-20,,

It was a pretty good deal considering it was last minute and I expected a lot of other people flying in SG for the U2 concert. Although my boyfriend had a problem with his passport so he ended up getting left behind. Lol   Anyway, I sadly arrived alone but I began feeling better when I arrived at our hotel. It is centrally located and just a few minutes walk from Raffles hotel as well. Kempinski is a heritage building that is tastefully restored to have a more modern and updated look. The entrance or lobby is quite small but well laid out. The lady concierge was gracious and sympathetic when I told her about my sob story.

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,Great staycation after the lockdown,"Stayed during the covid 19 phase 2. Finally can do a staycation after the lock down. Hotel staffs still maintain their great hospitality level during this period of time.   As the original gym and Swimming pool are not available at the current location, the temporary gym is now relocated elsewhere in another room within the hotel. Swimming pool is currently at the apartment beside the hotel. One of the units with a private pool is utilised during this period of time.   Will be back again later on for another round of staycation :).",Aug-20,,

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel and Lady In Red, Stella, attended to my special requests at such short notice and managed to pull off the surprise without any mishaps. A birthday cake with a customised message in chocolate and a handwritten birthday card with rose petals were provided in the room. The Lady In Red, Stella, ushered us right to our room and explained on the building's history and architectural features. The room comes in a comfortable king-size bed and a huge bathroom which comes in a street view.

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Second time with again incredible experience,"Iâ€™ve already been to The Capitol Kempinski Hotel back in December 2018 and had an incredible time. The entire interior is based on the colonial style of the building with modern and luxury elements perfectly included. Throughout the various categories of rooms and assemble areas this concept is harmonious and consistent. You feel the quality and passion for detail.  We were dining at 15 Stamford on their opening event on 20 December 2018. That night, I experienced a next level of taste. Thatâ€™s why I came back there this week. Again, I had a lovely and very delicious dinner. Outstanding food was the smooth foie gras and the on the point wagyu beef steak, completed with creatively mixed cocktails from the bar.

Breakfast good but served luke warm dishes and trainee who only had our table to worry about still managed to completely get our breakfast dish that we ordered wrong.  It happens BUT when you are the only customers and you repeat 3 times what you want and its still wrong is mildly frustrating to say the least.  This experience and the Alvin Leung experience is what led us to our overall rating.  Excellent is perfection and we did not experience this as such. We are not overly hard on ratings but I find lack of attention to customer specific requests in an environment with zero competing customers frustrating.  Chap at the front door (the older man) was always super friendly and genuinely happy to see us coming and going alwaysâ€¦,Mar-20,,
The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,A short staycation amidst COVID,"We had two Grand Deluxe rooms that were adjoining just before lockdown happened. The attentiveness of the staff reminded us of our experience at the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne. They were proactive and very welcoming.  The rooms themselves were comfortable and clean, and the baths were elegant yet luxurious. The only downside is that the rooms were very dark because there is a building right beside the window.  Breakfast was still the usual buffet-style (I'm sure it's not anymore) and delicious, and the Villeroy & Boch tableware elevated the whole dining experience.  We enjoyed our stay and will be back some day.",Mar-20,,
The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Great experience; highly recommended,"The Capitol Kempinski is one of the newer hotels on the scene, but they're well on their way to becoming one of the best hospitality experiences in downtown Singapore.   Beyond the tastefully appointed rooms and thoughtful amenities included, Stella, Lenten, Jimmy, Taj and the rest of the Kempinski team go out of their way to make guests feel comfortable and taken care of with their warm and personal service.  Would love to keep the Capitol Kempinski a hidden secret, but great experiences are meant to be shared. Definitely not your typical bland hospitality experience. We'll be back for sure.",Dec-20,,

I also fancy the location of this hotel, near mrt stations and a lot of nice restaurant located on the hotel's premises,  I wish i can give a full 5 ratings however services during breakfast was not up to 5 star standards that hotelier like kempinski should have.  I believe some of the waiters are young and lack of experience. There were two instances where i went to the buffet and get my table cleared up.   I also find one young waiter who keep staring at me akwardly only to later ask me whether i am allowed him to clear up my plates.  Another waiter also bump into me when i walk backâ€¦",Dec-19,,

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,1,A very disappointing afternoon tea!,"Visited the Kempinski Lobby Lounge for the afternoon tea with tea pairing on New Year Eve. The idea of tea pairing seems interesting as each course will pair with different flavor of tea. However, the tea cup was not replaced after each course. Meaning that you get to have tea of different blends of tea mixed together and leave you wondering what is the  exact blend of tea you are having for after 1st course. The cups & serving plates were only changed twice throughout the five courses. Serving of the tea was also very slow and you have to request several times before they top up the cup. Overall not a wonderful experience of having an afternoon tea with tea pairing at Kempinski unless you want to have a taste of tea ""mixing"" experience.",Dec-19,,

Whenever we were leaving the hotel for a tour through the city and when coming back we were greeted by name and got some insider tips about must-see-places in Singapore.  Breakfast was lovely and the hotel was such a wonderful combination of modern design and features in a historic building.

The location was also excellent.  You can get to most places within a few MRT stops away or a quick Grab ride.  The room was also modern with comfortable beds, not to mention the spacious bathroom.  The breakfast was also well stocked.  There was a variety of local food, which made my stomach dance every time I came down for the food.

Despite COVID, they didn't skimp on the breakfast. One of the most extension ala carte buffet breakfast menu offered during the Phase 2 period. While others hotels offering just 1 set of breakfast, you are allowed to order and eat all you want.

To our great delight, our faith has been restored by the Capitol Kempinski Staff :) Their attention to detail, personalized interaction and efficiency has been just amazing!! Going the extra mile seems to be the norm and the teamwork between the staff themselves makes you feel connected all the time.

Great pieces of decorative art in the rooms, solid bathroom fittings, impressive fruits, nuts and amenities set up in the room.  Very intimate check in with great service, and was given a special cake and a set of chocolates upon checkout for my bday as they were made aware of it by a friend.   Worthy mention was the breakfast at 15 Stamford, itâ€™s one of the best Iâ€™ve had from hotels in my years of travels.

Found that this was a nice gesture and I did notice that the hotel took note of some of these requests.   Due to the Phase 2 measures, the hotel breakfast is done ala carte style. As a result, their staff were busy and had missed out on our order. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our breakfast for both mornings as it was delicious and plated beautifully.

During check-in we asked about an extra bed, they said there is a sofa bed, which we can use as extra bed, they just need to make it ready. We mentioned to the reception staff that it is really, extremely important that they make it, and they reassured us everything will be ok by the time we are back from dinner. We came back at 11PM.

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,3,Beautiful Hotel But...,"It was a planned birthday staycation on a weekday and we specifically took our time off to enjoy my special day.  Check in was pleasant with a nice touch of being personally guided to the room. The decor of the room is tastefully designed to complement the renaissance exterior look but with modern amenities like Nespresso machine, wireless charging point, Smart TV with Full HD Channels, Sonos soundbar.  As we were busy checking out the room, the nice big tub, toiletries, minibar. Something caught my eyes just beside the wireless charging pad. Greeting us was a lifeless body of a cockroach. Luckily it was me instead of SO that discovered it. Perhaps it was the disinfectant that was strong enough to exterminate pest. Kind of eerie but yet comforting at the same time, i guess?

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,An Experience,"Check in was seamless with Cassandra & Tuah who are hospitable and warm. They both explained various amenities and facilities available.  However, disappointment arises when I was told there would be absolutely no pool usage even though I told the staff prior to check in about using the pool adjacent to the hotel. But this was easily recovered by Stella, Lady in Red, who did a stellar job at accommodating my request and even took the liberty to contact me personally through my mobile number when I was out, to deliver the good news! Also, ushering me to the pool via the custom buggy, with a bag of towels and oxygenated water.  Rooms were spacious with high ceilings to give a more cosy and airy feel. I personally like the feature of ""Do Not Enter My Room"" which is very thoughtfulâ€¦",Jul-20,,

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,4,"Five-star service, truly underrated hotel","One of the best staycations I've ever had.  Booked via a third-party platform and almost immediately received messages from the hotel asking if we were celebrating anything and how they could make our stay more comfortable. Requested a rollaway bed and for Apple TV to be set up and they were ready for us when we checked in as promised. As we were celebrating a few things, we were greeted with several cards, a gorgeous marble cake and a platter of delicious light bites.   Check-in and check-out were seamless. Delighted to discover that we were truly in the heart of Orchard Road - just a short walk to Wheelock Place but still private and closed off from the main traffic. And the view was unbeatable for our room!   Our favourite were the pools on the third (there's a jacuzzi too)â€¦",Nov-20,,

Weeks prior to our check-in date, I contacted them via the app to clarify about the check-in time. The response was instantaneous. They further inquired if we were celebrating a special occasion. Also, without me requesting, they informed me that they will arrange an complimentary extra bed for our son.  Upon arrival, the check-in process was smooth and quick. They explained properly the inclusions of the staycation package we availed of.  When we got to our room, we were pleasantly surprised with the childrenâ€™s amenities that were thoughtfully prepared - kidâ€™s bath gel, kidâ€™s toothbrush & toothpaste, kidâ€™s robe, kidâ€™s slippers, kidâ€™s welcome kit that included some sweets and a soft toy.

Breakfast service was amazing, remembered our preferences, including tea options. Pool service was great. Room was wonderful and clean and housekeeping done twice a day with no issues.

The rooms are recently refurbished so are well appointed, high quality tv's, good beds, decent coffee machine etc. The gym is excellent, obviously also a members health club but no issues there as that always means the gyms are well managed as opposed to being a token hotel gym. The hotel is deceptively big, you would never know it as you drive past, two swimming pools, two tennis courts etc. I have stayed at other four seasons and all are excellent, this is no exception. Other brands might claim to be premium in Singapore but this truly is. I will return for my next staycay.   Minor suggestion, consider making the downstairs pool the family poolâ€¦",Sep-20,,
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Top notch,This feels like a top notch hotel. Dealing with the front desk and the concierge was super easy. The concierge understood what we asked for and got us what we were looking for.  We got an upgrade on the room and got a room that seemed to have been very recently refurbished. Nicely decorated and comfortable. The only drawback was a quite poor hairdryer and the make-up mirror seemed to have been left over since before the refurbishment.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel.  The gym seemed to be brand new but the changing rooms in particular the gents seemed a bit old.  This was my first experience with a Four Seasons hotel and I will be sure to be looking out for a Four Seasons hotel on future trips.,Feb-20,,
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Fantastic hotel and service,"Great, great, great hotel.  Fantastic and consistent quality of facilities and service throughout the hotel and great location.

Hotel is high end, and the staff are all professional and super helpful.  Rooms are great, with a really comfortable bed. Bathrooms are modern.  Breakfast we enjoyed very much, and had recommended local dish each day.  Location is great for Orchard road shopping, and it a short taxi ride to Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and other attractions.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Nicely appointed five star rooms,"The four seasons know what's important. Luxery Bedding, Good Food c/w a full range of amenities. The hotel might be considered a little out of the way to some. There is a large luxury mall 5 to 10 minutes walk from the mall. Taxis are reasonable in Singapore and you rarely wait more than a minute.",Feb-20,,

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,4,Wonderful Stay,"I am picky about giving out five stars, and I probably would have given them five stars apart from one thing: I simply didn't stay here long enough to try everything and enjoy it.  So it is a solid four!  I checked in late and things went smoothly.  My suite was perfect with a good view.  I walked around the hotel, looking around and was impressed with what I saw.  In the morning, I had breakfast and the service was good as was the food.  I have absolutely no complaints and I look forward to staying here again.",Apr-19,,
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Great staffs but the room is not the best,"First time for Four Seasons SG. The location is great, not far from Orchard. The room reminds me of Four Seasons HK, the layout is quite the same.  The bed is comfortable but the thing i dislike is the air-condition. It is quite hot. Although I try to adjust it to the lowest 19C, it is still not cool enough (That trip I stay at Ritz and Raffles before Four Seasons, so I know that it is not the degree I wanted it to be).  And the room has some smell, it is not bad smell, bit it is not fresh.  The reception I met, Miku, she is the best of the best.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Oct-20,5,"the Gym is amazing! (and of course, the room)","Among all the local hotels which I have stayed, I dare say that Four Seasons Hotel has the best gym amongst all. In my list, Ritz Carlton's ranks second. Haven't found a third yet cos Conrad, Pan Pacific, St Regis, Capella and MBS's gym ain't even close.  The room is definitely comfortable and I liked how the toilet also has ceiling speaker installed. You are definitely not missing out in the show if you have to be in the toilet. Also, there's Airplay capability in the room TV, something which many others do not have. Breakfast wise, not as great as St Regis's but not too bad.  Overall, really amazing property. Will definitely be back to do another staycation in the future (without breakfast room option).",Sep-20,,

Several special touches in honor of her birthday, and (I suppose because occupancy was presumably on the low side) an upgrade to the 1-br suite. The room was outstanding: clean, comfortable, spacious (of course). The breakfast in the restaurant was a bit pricey as you'd expect, but quite tasty.

When u go out, just message them and ur room is clean when u get back. When u swim, they will come to give towels, cold drinks and even free dessert at times.

What is the point of offering drinks and coffee when the root of the problems were not even cater for...Time has changed, now people are looking for a total experience the moment we step into it.  I don't think I will come back if the rest of the stays are just as bad. Really spoilt the staycation even before it started. But I must give compliment to one particular staff by the name of Jean.

The Bar is really comfy and nicely decorated, I loved the fact that the decoration is luxurious and the ambiance very quite and suitable for a girly chit chat. The tea time comes with sparkling teas, regular drinks and savoury/sweet mignardises. I didnt try much of the sparkling teas as I am not a bubbles fan but my friend highly enjoyed it. My white tea was delicious as was the mocha (strong and corsÃ© like I prefer it).

I came because my travel plan got cancelled. Itâ€™s rather quiet during this period but thatâ€™s somewhat better because I got more personalized assistance and care from the staffs. Amrul (or Amirul?) on front desk has been kind and upgraded my room. I got 18th floor, the view is much better than my apartment and thatâ€™s exactly what I needed, a change of view after many weeks working from home.

As our home was under renovation during this period, and we had to bring our dog with us, we were very happy that Four Seasons accommodated us as our understanding is that it is a dog friendly hotel.  Our stay was very comfortable and we were made to feel very much at home. No request was turned away by the staff. There are too many of them to compliment but we would like to especially mention Yen Ling who arranged our stay, and who graciously allowed us a little more time to check out as our renovations were not complete. We also compliment Tuck Wah who responded quickly to our feedback.   Room wise, the beds are luxurious and very comfy, and relatively large inâ€¦",Aug-20,,
Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,"Amazing service, strongly recommend for a staycation!","We booked four seasons for a birthday staycation and the service was out of this world. As we have a baby girl, Four Seasons communicated with us before our arrival to find out her age so that they can make the necessary arrangements - eg provided some diapers, baby wash and even a thoughtful diaper bin. Of course, because it was a birthday staycation the cake was already set up in the room during our check in. In addition the staff were all very accommodating to our requests during the stay. We had three staycations since hotels opened for staycation in Singapore and Four Seasons hands down had the best service. We had a wonderful time and will definitely strongly recommend for a great staycation experience!",Aug-20,,

Great view. Love the bathroom. Bed and bedding SOOOO comfortable. We were there for a birthday (it was acknowledged with a cake to the suite, and cake at breakfasts and dinner).

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,3,Great service but far from everything,"The Four Seasons in Singapore is an older property.  The style of the building, the shape of rooms, etc are all from the 80'.   The service is the usual from FS, ie; very good. The only downside was arriving from a 25 hour flight, only to find the hotel bar closing early (basically in our face). They really should rethink this. A lot of the clientele arrive late at night and having a glass of wine would have been appreciated.  The roof top pool is very clean, but lacks charm. A few chaise longue, few plants and that's it.   The absolute best part of the hotel is breakfast. It is the BEST breakfast buffet I have experience in the world. No words can do it justice.   Lastly, note that hotel is not downtown. It's further north, in a nice shopping area. But you're not at all whereâ€¦",Sep-19,,

The little things they do and extra mile they go to, paying attention to the smallest detail to ensure we had an amazing stay, made us feel really blessed at guests. The bed we had was also very comfortable and the pillow options provided by the hotel is just brilliant. One can choose a variety of pillow styles to suit their sleeping needs.

Our room was perfect, with separate sleeping/living areas.  Plus, a kitchenette and washer/dryer.

The bedroom is dated and in dire need of renovations.  I got lounge access.  Lounge is newly renovated and staff service there is good. But breakfast and food at the evening cocktails can be improved.  The gym is well equipped and big and I am impressed.  The pool on the other hand is very small.

You simply need to request them, something I did not know to do.   On this visit I was given an executive floor room with a balcony and that was a treat. Itâ€™s nothing huge but to be able to sit out in the evening was good and Iâ€™ll suffer he step-in if I can get this every visit!  Service was good from the minute I arrived.

We spent a lot of time at the 22nd Floor level Club Lounge and thoroughly recommend it as a facility.The food at the cocktail and canapes session starting at 5.30 p.m. was superb-as was the service from some of the waiters. One person on the Club desk was a bit officious at breakfast time, but hat's an occupational hazard with these Clubs, and the kind workers inside the Lounge more than compensated for this slight annoyance. The rooftop swimming pool was superb and we whiled away many happy hours there despite the moody and changeable weather where dark clouds could suddenly mask the sun and muffle its warmth whilw wild winds whipped themselves up.",Dec-19,,

Room rate was very affordable. Room was nice and spacious. Clean and bright. Comfortable bed. Staff was very busy with the high rate of occupancy. They were professional in carrying out their responsibilities but not extremely friendly.  Understandable that safe measurement measures are in place and need to be strictly adhered to. The lift leading to the lobby was not in use. That means you have to drag your luggage up the side of the hotel to the main lobby. This was quite inconvenient. There is limited parking space in the basement car park. So even if they allow multiple exits and entries you are not assured of a parking lot when you return. Thatâ€™s something to bear in mind.

The location canâ€™t be beat. Right in the heart of the restaurants and shopping and close to the metro.

They put us different floors even though we asked for at least on the same level but they could not. The reviews I read on TA saying that it was a bit outdated and old hotel, those were correct and I would go as far to say that it was more an 4 star rather than a 5 star hotel.   Positive comments: located quite central on Orchard road, big and nice lobby. Big rooms (that is rare in Singapore) a swimming pool on top, spacious and well equipped gym.

The main issue was that as the hotel was operating with a reduced team of staff, the hotel was clearly not equipped to handle the sudden influx of large crowds and cope with the additional COVID-19 measures required during this period.  So there was a sizeable crowd and queue when I checked in at 3pm.

For example, there is no room makeup in the morning (understandably to minimize human contact). Also, the breakfast buffet and evening canapes have been reduced to set meals.

Not sure if it's worth the additional amount to upgrade as I could get rain shower even from cheap boutique hotels (other staycations).  Soundproofing is really bad, I could hear occupants from next door if they were conversing loudly and even heard their TV..

They ASSURED me that my room would be ready very soon. I waited and waited. Technically they have until 3 pm to have my room ready.  Well at 3:15, after numerous visits to the front desk, they informed me my room was ready. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE ROOM READY BY 3, and NEVER TOLD ME IT WAS READY UNTIL I ASKED. Next time you go to Singapore, stay at the Swissotel, next door. We had friends stay there and they were treated like royalty. And the accommodations were better, too. Skipâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,3,"Location good, service ok","First time to Singapore and could not have asked for a better location.  The hotel is a two minute walk to the City Hall MRT, linking you to Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay.  For closer places like Arab Street and Little India, the walk is about 15 minutes.  To/from Changi is +/- 20 minutes. Taxi or Grab is about 25 SGD.   As for the hotel, the service is just ok.  Our four night stay was not memorable at all.  For a five start luxury hotel, you would expect staff interactions.  A hello, welcome back, how is your stay...that goes a long way.    Guest room was large, internet was efficient and quick. The bed is VERY uncomfortable and even with a mattress topper, it did absolutely nothing to help.

Welcome drinks provided but can only be ordered through in-room dining. Fruit plate was given too. One of the tower still use for Covid Quarantine purpose but I donâ€™t feel insecure throughout the stay. Despite all these, it was a pleasant stay, and every staff is so helpful.

She followed up with requests promptly and is able to anticipate needs and wants.   Elaine, from Royal Service, assisted me professionally on noise issues (generated by housekeeping who would rather let doors slam on latches than to enter and exit rooms quietly. They also seem to enjoy gossiping loudlyin their native language along corridors). Elaine was attentive, albeit over the phone and made a note to stock up on preferred room amenities.

The hotel opened in 1980's, but the renovation was just completed in 2019 and it felt very modern and cozy inside. Most of the guests seemed to be local now that Singapore hasn't opened its door to inbound travellers yet, and making a reservation would be recommended for dining at the hotel restaurants.

Also this was more like fine dining than a steak sandwich - no complaints here. Also ordered Room service (chicken tikka sandwich) which was lovely. Amenities - a lot of the restaurants were closed or limited which, as it was raining, really reduced the options we had and definitely reduced the overall experience.

Good location on top of Raffles City complex with shopping mall and subway station on the premises - very convenient. Legendary Raffles Hotel just across the road. It is a typical high-end business hotel. Rooms were newly renovated with huge bathrooms with open showers and a big freestanding tub. View was decent from the South tower. My Fairmont Gold room however oddly did not have a desk, which was a little inconvenient for a business traveler. In the end, it did bother me much as we spent most of the stay working in our Singapore office. I would have complained and asked for room change if I had to work in my hotel room.

The room we had was very nice and appeared to have been recently upgraded.  Nice views over the city, the pools and tennis courts.  The facilities were nice.  Comfy bed, nice shower, a tap for hot and cold water, and a handy table and couch.  Breakfast was included in our package and was a very good buffet in Prego down at lobby level.

The breakfast in Preggo had such a large choice and had everything we wanted and much more.  The staff throughout the hotel were very good, helpful, polite and accommodating. We want to highlight 5 members of staff who stood out in terms of customer service.

So here I am, taking in my gorgeous guest room on the 17th level of this stunning hotel. My exterior view is of the Raffles hotel gardens and pool. My room is immaculately presented in every way.

Iâ€™m usually there for business but this time I was there with a family group for a birthday celebration. Norman Leong in reservations, who is such an asset to the hotel, helped me out in so many ways in the lead up to the trip, and it was wonderful from start to finish.

The hotel lobby was lovely with traditional decor for Chinese New Year.  The concierge arranged a wonderful private tour which was a true high point.  The 70th floor SKAI steak restaurant was mediocre.  The Prego breakfasts were great. The SPA had nice services at a reasonable price.

Later, when tables were available, she came back to us and asked if we wanted to move to comfortable seating for our breakfast, which we did.

Fairmont Singapore,Sep-20,3,Staycay and Celebration,"Love the room and interaction with the helpful staff. It was very sweet of them to prepare a lovely cake and handwritten birthday card for my birthday. Definitely a place worth spending time with your loved ones. Thank you so much!   The only down side and greatest turn off is really on the parking. Pretty disappointed that the hotel couldnâ€™t provide any complimentary parking (well, despite the fact that it was actually having some staycay promotion that highlighted on having parking ticket as part of the perks: complimentary ticket and also multiple entries for Raffles City parking during the stay). That would mean the hotel would indeed be able to provide some tickets, if it really want to.   Considering the fact that the hotel wanted to make my stay and celebration aâ€¦",Sep-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,The Shopping Mall hotel,"The Fairmont was our first pick for traveling base as everything was close and easy breakfast options for everyone. We stayed in 12th floor with view to the sea, service was excellent and rooms clean and tidy. The choice of the restaurants was also perfect you can eat with 5$ or 150$ itâ€™s your preference which you want. In-house metro stop The city hall is also convenient. Highly recommend.",Feb-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,4,A welcoming hotel with large rooms and two pools,"Our stay here was great.  The staff are very friendly, welcoming and go out of their way to be helpful. We stayed in a corner room which is 50% bigger than the standard room and was more than big enough for two adults and two kids.   The kids loved the pool. The hotel is also close to the colonial district and river and so there are plenty of good walks very near the hotel. It is also handy having an MRT station right on the front door and the Raffles City food hall underneath the hotel.",Jan-20,,

Fairmont Singapore,Dec-20,4,i have a lot to tell,"Overall the hotel is comfy and service is good. Just a few area to improve then it will be perfect for me. We like the hotel except for the food.  we ordered room service for breakfast which is included in room package. I would say they serve the worst pancake and waffle, cold and hard for my poor kid to eat. Porridge for hubby is ok. Hash brown is hard as stone. Hope your chef take note of food served to your guests. We could have go down to Prego.   Dialed  your Royal Service phone line and 0  operator many many times and nobody pick up, Waited and waited.  I hv worked in hotel training  before, phone should be answered in 3 rings.  Fairmont own website and Accor website gave different information about room cancellation policies. Accor ALL site is selling rooms at south towerâ€¦",Dec-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Aug-20,4,Staycation solo,"Was a value for money stay and the balcony is a rare gift as not many hotels offer private balconies.

Overall, I recommend all genres of stayers from business to family to solos stayers.",Aug-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Fabulous hotel!,"Loved this hotel! Great location, particularly for a first timer in Singapore. Made to feel very welcome from the moment I arrived. The room and view from the room was fantastic. Nice touches with the full control of lighting and curtains! Large, incredibly comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. Breakfast was excellent. Great choice of food to suit everyone. Staff at the breakfast service were particularly friendly and welcoming. Check in was very smooth & quick. Checking out was easy enough too & there is the opportunity of using the Hospitality room where you can freshen up or relax before heading to the airport if you have a later flight.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,4,Fairmont Singapore,"Recently had a pleasant weekend stay at Fairmont Singapore in the King Premier room. It was spacious, both the room and the bath. View were awesome and staff were polite. Do note that the water from the in house filter has a metallic taste and there is no free parking for cars due to the carpark belonging to the mall. You may ask for valet parking at $35 for 24 hours.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent Location and Customer Service,"I always stay in this hotel when I visit Singapore. Being a regular in this hotel, they usually upgrade my room which I am thankful for, however, I still find the air-conditioning not that cold even though I turned it down to the lowest temperature. Also their breakfast this year during the CNY period was held in the ballroom and there were lots of activities for the little ones and my kids enjoyed it so much, thank you for the extras the hotel has put in for the guests.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,City stop before Maldives,"We stopped in Singapore on our way to the Fairmont in Maldives. The Fairmont brand is luxury and Fairmont Singapore definitely delivers in spades. Our room had the most stunning city view, the service was professional and prompt in every respect and we got special treats recognising a 50th birthday. The breakfast was one of the best weâ€™ve seen with ample selection, and the club lounge a real treat. The location is perfect for easy access to all modes of transport. A definite hotel option for any type of stay in Singapore. Thanks Rob and the Fairmont team for a memorable stay.",Feb-20,,

Fairmont Singapore,Dec-20,5,Good location,"The hotel is well located at Raffles City and connected to city hall mrt. Travelling within town area is a breeze.  The check in and check out process is swift.  Though there is still queue for checking in, the queue is considered short compared to those that have long waiting time. They have the E check in which is able to cut down on the processing time.  Simarly for checking out, it is even faster with express check out where there is a staff to assist with the swift check out.  The room is big and comfortable for a family of 4. For the package that we have bought, they have included a roller bed for us as well.  The only area of improvement is the ordering to the kitchen of Prego.

Paid a little more for the heritage suite and the room was huge with a seating area plus a working desk. In the package was a an extra bed which was set up before we arrived.   Knowing that it was my kids birthday, the hotel prepared a nice chocolate in the room when we entered...nice surprise!   There were 2 balconies which were good, only wished I could have a higher floor room though.   What I liked was the alternative given for breakfast...either go down to Prego or have it in-room. It was a wonderful experience for the kids to have â€˜breakfast in bedâ€™.   Besides the $100 credit for dining in, we had ours at Prego (remember to book before hand cos the slots gotâ€¦",Aug-20,,

Fairmont Singapore,Jun-20,1,Poor Service Manager EQ (Jayven Lim),"I am a local who frequently patronise this hotel at Antidote. However, today, I only passed by this hotel that is linked to Raffles City Shoppjng Centre form its concierge and for some reasons my chauffeur had to pick me up from the hotel driveway.   During this period, I perfectly understand the COVID-19 preventive measures hotels will take. I cooperated with the Tracking App and temperature measurement etc. At the check in area, they asked me about my entry into the hotel and I explained to them only to be stopped by the service manager to be asked a second time why I was going. I told him politely and also let him know that I have already been repeating myself a second time. Then as my back was hurting and it would take another 5 minutes of wait for my chauffeur to arrive, Iâ€¦",Jun-20,,

Staff, from Check-in (like Cherly and Abbey at Front desk) to room attendant (pho), F&B staff at all the outlets, in particular Pregos and The Stamford Brassiere, where they made us enjoy our scrumptious meals in warm and friendly atmosphere.

Fairmont Singapore,Mar-20,5,Covid-19 self quarantine stay at FAIRMONT,Hotel has a fantastic team working there. They are so hardworking in ensuring that quarantine guests are well taken care of while abiding to the self quarantine measures and take guest feedback seriously. Hotel not only checks in with guest daily but have impressed to put the personal touch to what hospitality is all about. They have gone above their jobs to really ensure guests are truly happy just by paying attention to details; team surprised me with a local breakfast and also personally signed cards with messages to celebrate Day 9 milestone in my quarantine period. Really awesome hotel to stay at!!,Mar-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Mar-20,5,Lovely stay in a fine hotel with perfect service,"I stayed 5 nights in this hotel and it was a really excellent experience. During my visit, the corona virus had begun to become present in Singapore and everywhere you went, the staff offered hand sanitiser and were taking great care of the guests health and safety. The service in all departments was excellent. In particular, I would like to mention Nisa Ghani in the pool bar area, Dennison who made excellent Pina colada and sangria, and  Edmande in the downstairs bar. But really all the staff were fabulous. The breakfast is one of the best you can imagine. Everything is on offer. there was a huge array of already cut fruit and vegetables so that you can make your own custom-made juice, the hot buffet was amazing - everything from ""make your own soup"", to delicious dim sum,â€¦",Feb-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Dec-20,1,Worst horrible night in Fairmont Singapore,"Writing in my experience at Fairmont Room 2308 checked in on Tuesday 8 December . It was literally the worst day of my life. I called at 10 plus pm to get help with my air conditioning which is not cold but no one came. At 11.30 I called regarding my neighbour was banging on the wall but nothing was done as the banging carried on. My breakfast, i chose American set but i wasnâ€™t given any bread at all, just eggs. My dinner i asked for 8.30pm but was serve at 8pm, in the end i had to take my medicine earlier. Everything was really a extremely horrible experience. It was a huge price to pay for getting a worst experience at Fairmont Singapore. Im so so so so speechless and disappointed. Never will i step my foot at your hotel again. I will post all these reviews at all platforms.â€¦",Dec-20,,

Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,1,Didnâ€™t live up to 5 star,"Booked a staycation for husbands birthday. Requested for deco and contour pillows which were all fulfilled nicely and perfectly, flower petals, teddy bear and chocolates... All went downhill when the room we had was leaking, floor was wet outside the toilet. Turned out it was blockage from the aircond pipe. They handyman came at 8pm and repair it while we were in the room! We left the room and got the hotel to wheel our luggage to the new room while we go for our dinner reservation.  The replacement room we were given is 3 floors lower, expected the hotel to give us a better or same room after the inconvenience. Contour Pillows did not follow the luggage, only realized itâ€™s not there at 12am. Called in for contour pillows but normal flattish feather pillow and blanket cameâ€¦",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Excellent all round,"Hotel is modern, very central, has metro in the basement as well as walk through from the hotel to a large shopping mall.  You can also walk underground through to a number of other shopping malls rather than brave the heat on the streets.  Complementary beautifully decorated chocolate cake sent to our room when we arrived as this was a birthday trip - a lovely unexpected touch that was appreciated.  The room was well appointed, we had a city view, breakfasts were excellent so much choice and great service from the staff.  Was so easy to go to Raffles, and the harbour area or hop on the metro and go further out. Would certainly recommend - pricey - but convenience and ambivalence worth the cost!",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,5,Great hotel,Great hotel! Staff friendly and helpful! Great views! Amazing breakfast so many options. Big spacious room and lovely shower. Lovely pool. Right next to the shop and train station. Just be aware if you use the Gold Lounge please be aware the children under 12 years old are not allowed 530pm-730pm as they are serving alcohol and dress must be formal. Unfortunately they serve hot food  at that time as well but you can have takeaway containers to take it to your room.,Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Best Hotel for Service & Location,"The Fairmont is well positioned in Singapore, right on top of a major train station and shopping plaza. The rooms are large, well appointed and serviced. The restaurants all provided quality food and beverage at reasonable pricing. An excellent resort pool and plenty of bars to chill out.

Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,"Fantastic view, highly trained staff in all sections",We had a room on the 21st Floor of the South Tower.The view across to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel  never failed to impress.  The view at night was spectacular as the Theatres by the Bay domes light up in red with the lighted towers of MBS behind them.  The Padang was flanked n one end by the SRC and on the other by the SCC. The Supertrees of Gardens by the Bay lit up as well with the backdrop of the Fullerton Hotel and the financial district.  The  South Tower room was spacious and well appointed.  Staff were professional and highly trained in all sections of the hotel from cleaning staff to front desk,Feb-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Great return stay,We had a great time over the CNY holidays. Great breakfast options at Prego and Iâ€™m happy to see that the menus (even the room service) had options for kids. The only thing we did not like was the aircon controls in the room as even if we lowered down the temperature it was a bit warm for us. We failed to report this though given our short stay. We will definitely return again sometime in the Future.,Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Dec-20,2,Hotel isnâ€™t what it once was - Disappointed,"The Fairmont Singapore used to be fantastic 5 star hotel which I have stayed at many many times since 2013, however the most recent experience was terrible to say the least.   The rooms have been refurbished over the years and are very spacious and lovely however there is unfortunately no â€œfairmont serviceâ€ anymore. By comparison my experience of their service is of a reasonable 3 star hotel.   So what went wrong?  1) ordered dinner on my first night of arrival which arrived stone cold. It was clear that order had been left around for some time before it arrived. Naturally, I called in room dining and they sent up another dish 20mins later. However this should not have happened in the first place.   2) ordered breakfast on my second day; toast, orange juice and jam. Only orangeâ€¦",Dec-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Sep-20,4,Good stay.. but...,"Back here to have a focus day to deal with some important work.  Everything is as per expected from early check-in to late checkout, recognition of Accor platinum, room upgraded to a suite but at the non renovated old north tower as the south is occupied by stay home notice folks. Room is really clean.  I was also happy as they still remember the bottle of wine that I left during my last stay.  However, one thing disappointing to point out during breakfast at Prego.  I wasnâ€™t very happy when the breakfast order is kind of limited to one order only per person, I ordered the dim sum set and it came with a miserable few pcs of small dim sum and I was told that not allowed to order another bowl of noodle or omelette or pan cakes... not even another cup of coffee espresso or fruitâ€¦",Sep-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Mar-20,5,Top Class Hotel in the Heart of the City,"This was a return visit to the Fairmont, having stayed here 3 years ago. Our room overlooking Marina Bay and the Pedang would be hard to beat with its floor to ceiling windows. The location above the Raffles Mall and next to the City Hall Metro station meant we were convenient for shopping, restaurants and travel connections. However, we ate at the Fairmont's Italian Restaurant, Prego, which is conveniently located near to Reception and we found it to be excellent. We are looking forward to staying there again on our return leg to the UK.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Aug-20,2,Discrimination,"Planned to stay here for 3 nights as my kids really love the pools but ended up checking out on the second night. Really disappointed, especially the pool service by the particular staff. Understand that there was a 2 hour swimming time limit but my 2 and 5 years old kids were eating (they have already changed  and not in their swimwear) and the staff asked us to leave the place right away.  But, the other guests that came at the same time as me were still at the pool even from my room before I checked out they were still at the pool. Why do I being treated differently?. However the frontdesk service is excellent especially Abigail.",Aug-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Best hospitality,"We stayed at the Fairmont to celebrate the Lunar NY and had a wonderful stay.  It's hard to find a fault with this hotel, everything was perfect for us.  We enjoyed the complimentary gym, jacuzi, steam room and sauna everyday either before breakfast or before bed.  The hotel is located within the Raffles City Shopping Centre with City Hall MRT right below so the location is ideal for visitors.  Our room overlooked the Raffles Hotel across the road.  I booked the room at the hotel as an Accor member.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Dec-20,5,Staycation with SRV,"The king bedded room is nice, though it's a city view room. I opened up the balcony and saw it facing Raffles Hotel and Carlton Hotel.  There are some dusty areas in the room. However that can be easily made up with the ample supply of bottled water as well as toiletry provided.   I asked for additional blankets at 1am, and it was delivered at about 1.25am after one reminder call. But the staff who I came in contact with are all patient, smiley and nice!  The other negative point which I can point out will probably be, it's super difficult to be able to get down to lobby at check out time. It took me about 20 to 30 mins. Can this aspect be improved please.   Like the hotel, will be back!",Dec-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Fabulous,"Recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on our way to Thailand, on arrival we were offered an upgrade to a bay view room in the south tower with club lounge facilities. The room was fabulous, very tastefully decorated with great attention to detail. The club lounge was a brilliant idea, very relaxing and attentive staff food and drinks lovely, breakfast catered for everyone's tastes and the hotel location was perfect for seeing the beautiful sights of Singapore. Every member of staff we met especially in the club lounge and antidote bar were very friendly and helpful, will definitely return to this lovely hotel and gorgeous Singapore",Feb-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Just wanna visit again !,"Stayed in Fairmont for 4 nights for a conference and leisure holiday in August last year.  Didnâ€™t expect that Fairmont also got such fantastic view overlooking the marina bay !  The deluxe king room is very spacious. Got a large writing desk, another sofa and coffee table area, so both of us can each occupy a private corner.  Very unlucky, I was not feeling well on the second day and need to take rest in the room for almost the whole day.  But on the contrary, it gave me such a good time to relax in the room, enjoying the bay view, as well as the delicious noodle delivered from room service.  Breakfast are served both in the hotel restaurant and the pool side lounge. We chose the pool side for our breakfast cos there would be less guests. The choice of food is well sufficientâ€¦",Aug-19,,
Fairmont Singapore,Oct-20,3,"Welcoming Start, went downhill with every experiences","Breakfast service was disappointing - one is restricted to selection of one course from either main or side menu, one small glass of juice and a cup of coffee, and a small fruit platter per room. No bread/pastries due to current pandemic situation - what has the situation got to do with bread/pastries? If the quality/quantity of a product is compromised, it is not a promotional offer, but a low cost option. Please get the framework sorted out before beating drums about promotional rate for staycation.   A hilarious and alarming feedback from housekeeping when we feedback that the next door guest is having a party with multiple guests which goes on overnight and if that is doable - unless we received complaints from guests, we would not restrict guests going up to room and checksâ€¦",Oct-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,4 Nights in Singapore,We stayed in a Gold Room which included breakfast and pre dinner drinks/ hors dâ€™oeuvres. The hotel is in a great location close to Marina Bay and City Hall station. All your staff were fantastic and a credit to the Fairmont Hotel!,Jan-20,,

The hotel is well located and you can access the shops and train station within a minute as the hotel is located above the the shopping plaza and train station.

I recommend Fairmont Singapore to all my families and friends without any hesitation. Keep up the good work Fairmont Singapore hotel",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,5,Outstanding on all counts,"This hotel is one to strongly consider when visiting Singapore.  The location, cleanliness, service levels, rooms, check in process and general spirit of the hotel are all superlative.  Can't fault much of anything.  A couple of minor issues - the Concierge could have been a bit more knowledgeable and the Prego restaurant (during breakfast) was a little overwhelmed by a rush situation, but both issues were minor.  The hotel is built over and next to a shopping mall and ""Street Food"" location so shopping and dining options are plentiful.  Hop on hop off bus pick up is across the street as is Raffles Long Bar for the obligatory Singapore Sling experience.  Overall, an outstanding and well run hotel that provided an experience that, in my estimation, would be hard to beat.",Jan-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,"Fabulous Accommodation , Great Location","Stayed 2 nights , arriving at 3am , we chose to upgrade our room to allow immediate check in as well as complimentary breakfast and Happy Hour drinks and snacks in the private lounge on the 25th floor. Our room had an excellent view of Marina Bay Area and we felt the upgrade was well worth the value. The staff is incredibly gracious and helpful.

My stay was perfect from start to finish - incredible customer service provided by all staff, my newly refurbished room was so lovely with views across to Marina Bay etc so fireworks viewed from the comfort of my own balcony. The bed and huge pillows were super comfy, the deep bathtub gorgeous after a day walking around in the heat and staff kept everything spotlessly clean. Little requests for more teabags or coffee, an ice bucket etc were always attended to. I made full use of the swimming pool and the gym too which was really well equipped.

Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Top class hotel in a great location,"Had a 5 day break in Singapore at The Fairmont. Superb hotel in a great location with the famous Raffles Hotel and 'The Long Bar' just across the road. Many local amenities and attractions were within comfortable walking distance, but not all. The room at the hotel was spacious with a great view from the 21st floor and had all the facilities you would expect.All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was served from 0600-1030 during the week and catered for all requirements. The hotel was literally joined on to the Raffles City shopping plaza where there were many floors of shops and eateries.

The water temperature for swimming pool was just perfect! Wish they had more shades though.  Breakfast at Prego, had so many choices but after a few days of same food, you kind of change into something else, then you can go to other restaurant in the hotel. They all taste really good.

Fairmont Singapore is a wonderful hotel.",Dec-20,,
Fairmont Singapore,Mar-20,3,Premium price but getting a bit old and outdated,"I stayed here with my wife and 2 kids.  Although the Fairmont costs more than the Swissotel, it is just right next to it. In fact, the Fairmont being the short tower has worse views from the rooms compared to the much taller Swissotel.  Both hotels are very similar and I have stayed at both so I don't see why the Fairmon rates are higher.  I actually find that the Fairmont rooms are a bit old and outdated.  The hotel is connected to the Raffles City shopping mall with MRT right underneath so it is very conveniently located for shopping, dining and taking the train to explore Singapore.  The swimming pool is a common pool shared with Swissotel.  That means there are guests from both hotels using the same pool.  The pool is located in between the two hotels so the sun gets blockedâ€¦",Oct-19,,
Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,Flexible and welcoming,"We were in Singapore for a cruise but when it was cancelled at the last minute we were left with no flight home and nowhere to stay. Fortunately we had booked three days at the Fairmont for after the cruise and they were so kind, readily changing our booking so that we had three nights there and had time to get another flight home. This is a beautiful hotel and so well located. We used the readily available taxis to get around and the doormen were always available to hail one for us. The room was huge and the beds very comfortable. We had breakfast at Prego each morning, delicious and great service.

Fairmont Singapore,Feb-20,5,"World-class service, excellent amenities, just need to fix the plastic water bottle problem","We enjoyed our 3 nights at the Fairmont Singapore, much in thanks to the incredible people who work there, most notably the front desk, housekeeping and porters. They take time for little things like saying hello or waiting a little extra to open doors and elevators. Our room was much more spacious than we thought, and the cleaner did a great job making the room immaculate for us every afternoon.  The gym is super clean and spacious, with all the weights and cardio equipment we could ever need. The spa is also amazing, with a steam room, sauna and various hot/cold tubs. The pool = perfection, and not too crowded.

Fairmont Singapore,Jan-20,5,Great Singapore stay,Stayed in the beautiful and newly refurbished deluxe quad room with my family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) in December.  We were very happy to call the Fairmont Singapore our home for 7 nights.  The room was well appointed and clean.  Iâ€™m glad we paid that but extra to get a refurbished room.  We stayed on the 16th floor and had a view of the Singapore skyline - absolutely gorgeous at night!   The room was massive and we loved hanging out on the couch/table area.  Most days it doubled as our dining area. The beds and pillows were so comfy and we loved fairmontâ€™s commitment to Eco friendliness and sustainability.  We especially loved the water filter in the room! It was a wonderful surprise to find the curtains draw open automatically as you enter the room.  Check in and check outâ€¦,Dec-19,,

The staff were very helpful and always smiled especially the doormen.  As it was our first trip to Singapore the location was central to a lot of attractions and the concierge helped us with what to see and how to get there.  We   celebrated St Valentine's day with High Tea at Anti:dote and would recommend the experience to anyone.  Overall an great experience which we will do again.,Feb-20,,

Amin went above and beyond. He was very communicative in emails before arrival. After arrival, Amin knew we wanted Peking Duck during Chinese New Year and wanted to make sure we didn't lose our dinner reservation. He ran down to the Szechuan Court restaurant himself to make sure the hostess held our reservation. To express our appreciation, we brought the Lounge staff the huge portion of the Peking Duck that we could not even begin to approach. Breakfast and hors d'oeuvres in the Lounge were great.

The room decor and facilities were excellent. I particularly liked the automatic curtains that could be controlled from the bed, and the drinking tap and loan of reusable water bottle to help reduce plastic use.  Breakfast was plentiful and varied. I had room service late one evening and it was good quality. The hotel is centrally located right by the MRT, making it ideal for exploring the city.

The room food service and the poolside food service were of the highest quality. The hotel was within walking distance to everything, or a short taxi drive if one does not feel like walking. The adjacent shopping mall was very handy and so is a quick stroll across the street to the Long Bar at Raffles hotel. A nice walk to the waterfront and to the Gardens by the Bay, various museums .

However the first night was a nightmare and I would caution anyone assigned with level 19 in the North Tower to be vigilant on special noises, suspected to be pumping noises from the walls between the bedroom and the toilet. It was late at night when we noted such noises and we made 2 calls to report the issue but as the noises were intermediate, it was not heard when the plumber visited. We didn't request to switch to a different room immediately and it was proven a disastrous decision. It was a sleepless night and every now and then throughout the night, there were random noises.   It was supposed to be a staycation to get relaxed but we certainly got more stressed and frustrated.   We wish the hotel canâ€¦",Nov-20,,

Small touches are not at all forgotten, for example, when she repeatedly checked if a problem we had in our room with the connection between laptop and TV had been fixed. Whenever she saw us in the lobby, she would unhesitatingly ask, and render further assistance (and apologies!

I think that the hotel also did well in having an advance booking system in place for swimming pool and gym, which I think helped in reducing queues at the reception during the Christmas peak season.  However, the club service certainly required much improvement. It was a pity that the booking system for swimming pool and gym was not extended to the club lounge.

Each instance was small but they really add up when staying there for two weeks.  A few of the instances I can recall:  - The first porter to greet me and take my luggage was obviously fishing for a tip. He's the only hotel staff, and only person in Singapore during my stay for that matter, that seemed to be trying to get a tip.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Nov-20,3,Beautiful hotel.. let down by the service.,We stayed for 2 nights in a Junior Suite and arrived at 5pm on a Friday to find that our room was not ready. Terrible start to a weekend away in a hotel that we had been really excited to stay in. We waited in the lobby for an hour whilst our room was being cleaned and the manager only came to speak to us after being requested numerous times. This service level set the standard for the rest of our stay... waiting an hour for an ice bucket to be delivered to our room and an hour for breakfast on Sunday morning. Something just seemed to be very wrong with the service.  The hotel itself is stunning and the room and all of the facilities were fantastic - but it was let down by the poor service.,Nov-20,,

Even up till the moment she left, she did provide us reassurance on what we were promised and we were handed over to the next sales coordinator in a proper manner.   Andrea appeared to be very young and lively but we were worried that she was not experienced enough at the beginning. But our fears were slowly replaced by assurance as she was detailed meticulous and responsive to our queries, gave us timely reminders leading up to our big day.

Lin Hussin whom was sales director helped to ensure my stay was far better than other hotels that I have stayed.  Here are some specifics. 1. Orchid club lounge is worth it.  Great view, food, staff and happy hour.  Singapore is not a cheap place to have a cocktail or two or more.  The service staff on the floor were very attentive and food was good.  I like that they staffed with a chef to prepare individual specials they have. 2. Location is great.  It's 10 minute walking distance from my company office in business district area which I liked because I did not have to take a taxi.

The room was a decent size and all wood panelling and not many light fittings which seemed to mean it was permanently dark. Even itâ€™s the blinds open during the day it was dark. The room servicing was again ok. We had a bath mat for the shower on the first day, but that disappeared and we didnâ€™t get another. Fortunately they forgot to take one of the towels so we used that. The toilet is very dark. You really needed to leave the sliding door open, but couldnâ€™t if you had the blind open as anyone walking down the walkway (external) to rooms could see in.

We felt safe with temperature screening for all incoming guests and hand sanitizers placed everywhere.  We are a family of 4 (2 kids 7 and 5) and found the junior suite suited our needs. We had the bedroom while the kids used the lounge area which had a sofa bed and there was a sliding door if needed to separate the 2 areas.

Unfortunately, the hotel management caused us great distress and unhappiness on our last night. On the 3rd day of our stay, we accidentally placed a hot iron on the table surface which is made of glass. (We had no idea the table was made of glass initially). We wanted to report of this incident to the hotel after we finished our day activities but their house keeper discovered first and reported it. The hotel management informed us that we have to pay for the repair which cost around $200 - $250 which I did not disagree. However, this gets worse when they get back to us with the actual cost which is about $400. I was completely surprised that the cost went up to 400 from the original 200.

But upon check-in, we were given a complimentary upgrade to the Anderson Suite, one of 5 Theme Suites that the hotel has. This was a pleasant surprise. The Suite was impeccably furnished and maintained and was very spacious. It came with a separate living area, king-sized bed, and a bathtub (with its own television). The outstanding thing about the room are its eye-catching views of the Marina Bay.  I strongly recommend a visit to the outdoor rooftop pool at night to relax and soak up the fantastic night views of the skyline.  Service throughout the hotel was excellent as well.

All the sweets were pink in support of breast cancer awareness month. The scones, savouries and coffee/tea are refillable as well (very value for money!).

However, upon checking-in the room, no sight of the cake nor balloon. I have to call the reception not once but multiple attempts. On the line, the staff mentioned she will look into it.

The restaurant has an innovative way for guests to order their selection from the menu, using a QR code that links to an online ordering system.  Not only does this ensure one can pace oneself and avoid having all dishes served at the same time, when your selection arrives it has been freshly prepared.   We arrived at 12:00 noon and departed at 3:00pm, which says it all really. The staff are attentive & courteous and on hand to answer any questions regarding the self ordering process.

In particular, I would like to especially compliment two staff who have made our stay at the hotel an exceptionally joyful one:  1) Oliver Shoh from ConciergeÂ  From the moment we stepped into the hotel, Oliver earnestly attended to our every single need, from settling our luggage during check-in and check-out to orientating us in the hotel to ensure that we are not â€œlostâ€.

The hotel is conveniently located and linked by a walkway to Millenia Walk, which also has an MRT stop, and another shopping centre (Marina Square).  I stayed here for a transit in early March, when the effects of COVID-19 were already felt in Singapore and it was less busy than usual.     The room is generously sized but rather plain and old-fashioned, with two prominent features which are the wall-to-wall panoramic window (it's a great view from a high floor, whether towards Marina Bay or Kallang district), and the octagonal window from the bathroom.

The London duck was so aromatic and moist, it's probably the best thing I'm going to have tasted in 2020. I usually scrape all the fats off duck skin, but I ate every bit of this duck, including the fats and it wasn't greasy at all.   Service, as always, was impeccable.

However, I was solely disappointed with the level of service provided by a so-called 6 star hotel, right from the arrival of our staycation.  Firstly, the hotel is undergoing renovations and it was terribly noisy at the Level One check-in area. We were made to wait for quite some time before Jerrol served me at the check-in counter. He informed me that my booking does not come with breakfast, and that I'd have to pay $48++ per pax.

I was also never expected the room is big enough to have a tent inside yet still have ample space for us to walk around and my daughter to run around. The next area is the toilet, where there is ample space as well for a big bathtub. At this point in time, staff morale could below where a lot of jobs could be uncertain.

Unlike us, he remembered our names and had a chat each time we arrived and left the hotel- very impressive. We were checked in early and given a room on the same level as the Club Lounge.  I was concerned that the room might have been a bit noisy as it was directly opposite the lounge.  I am a very light sleeper!  I asked if it was possible to be moved to a quieter area of the hotel.

Room was big and comfortable. Had a wonderful time soaking in the big and deep bathtub while enjoying the beautiful view. The hotel truly goes for extra mile to make the guests happy and comfortable by providing a bath pillow, which I have yet to see one in other 5-stars hotels that I had stayed before.

I've dined at the restaurant a few times now, but I'm still impressed every time I visit. It certainly deserves the Michelin Star which has been awarded to it for a few years now, and I firmly believe it serves the best Cantonese cuisine in all of Singapore.

And unlike in Japan where I was warmly welcome, I didn't feel I received a warm greeting at all even considering the difference in culture.  The room wasn't as luxurious as the Ritz in Osaka or Tokyo but it was bigger with big round windows even in the bathroom.

About the room, i felt that it is dated and hope that Ritz SG will renovate the rooms soon.

However, they gave us a wonderful corner room on the top floor that had a partial view of the flyer. Our two-year-old daughter was thrilled to lean in to see the big wheel. It is a very kid-friendly hotel. The service is really outstanding and warm. We had vegetarian requests and they made sure they catered to our needs.

The Christmas goodies on sale were a true delight and I even carried a lot of it back home with me. This time I was booked in a Marina room and the view was breathtaking, the photos donâ€™t do justice on how wonderful the view was at all times.

The attendant told us the next available timing is only at 8pm, no worries full I get it. Started booking for next day, and only 7am and 1pm is available. Alright 7am then!

The pool fantastic also. The restaurant very over priced considering you can hop across the road to the hawkers and get the same food for pennies compared to pounds, but a top choice for anyone who wants to stay in a bit of luxury. A short walk from the shopping centres itâ€™s in a great location. Iâ€™d recommend anyone going to look out for the electric scooters you can pick up and pay on your mobile for, theyâ€™re everywhere and make seeing Singapore a breeze.

An example would be one staff member would say Halal food is unavailable in the resort while another staff says that Halal food is available at the property. After a long day at work I think I deserve a Halal meal in my room when I stay at a luxury hotel rather than having to go outside myself to find a Halal dish.

There is a beautiful terrace on the ground floor looking across the bay offering very comfortable seating. Access to this terrace appeared to be through the main Resturant. This had a very plush, upmarket feel. We glanced at the menu which was as expected for the quality of this Resturant. We didn't eat there so, cannot comment on the food, but believe me I wouldn't hesitate for a special occasion. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, with an air of opulence  and beauty.

The hotel clearly knows itâ€™s operating at maximum capacity but made no effort whatsoever to expand their breakfast capacity and was somehow miraculously hoping for self regulation.  Come on guys - firstly to manage covid 19 there should have been extra measures like maybe opening up another area (eg the bar upstairs or the empty ballroom) instead of everyone queueing along a crowded corridor.  Or getting hotel guests to pick a staggered breakfast time. At the moment Iâ€™ve been queueing for 30 min.

There are some excellent happy hour deals too! 2. Check-in was very efficient; the young-ish staff did it with minimal hassle.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Best choice for staycation in the midst of a pandemic.,"Date of stay: 2nd Oct - 3rd Oct Room: Fabulous, 2 beds, Pool view with Balcony  We booked this on a whim as we wanted to extend our staycation after our stay in RWS's Equarius hotel, so W Hotel was our choice as we had a rather good experience when we stayed in W Hotel Taipei, plus some positive experiences during our dining at W Hotel, Sentosa Cove.  Checked in at 2.30pm, room was already available and waiting for us. That was a good surprise, because we thought it could take longer due to the need to disinfect rooms.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,5,"Wonderful Staycation, Just Needs A Few Tweak's","We had a wonderful stay at the W, the rooms were really nice and very spacious, the plunge pool is definitely worth the extra, especially if you're on a staycation, as you can only use the main pool for 2 hours. Breakfast was fantastic, although could be organized a little better. Rather than pick the two-hour time slots just book in a time for breakfast, everyone goes at the same time, and it's really busy. I would have appreciated an early check-in especially mid-week, we're just sat at home waiting to arrive and then couldn't check in till 3 pm (Our forwarding hotel allowed us to check-in at 12 pm and check out at 3 pm) these are difficult times so a little give would be nice, seeing as we're all spending a lot of money for staycations which we wouldn't normally do.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,3,Missed the mark for our recent staycation,"My husband and I were desperate to get away, and decided to splurge on a one night getaway down at the beautiful W Hotel Resort in Sentosa.  The facilities did not disappoint.  The resort was well kept, and our room, the pool and other common areas were all lovely and sparkling clean.    Unfortunately, however, the service was VERY hit or miss throughout the hotel.  Our check-in, for example, went great, with lots of smiles and quick and effective information shared.  We were given a ""free drink"" ticket which we thought was a very nice welcome.  However, that ""free drink"" could only be consumed in our room because their bars are now closed, and it was limited to a VERY basic menu  (i.e., a house-pour spirit, in a shot format, with a carbonated soft drink mixer- no cocktails, noâ€¦",Aug-20,,

However, I was very tempted to give this review a 3 stars because Pool & Pool service was terrible. I would imagine at this time most people are only staying at the W for a staycation so pool time is the main reason for this. We were fine with scheduling 2 hours of pool time but when we went to the pool we found the pool area to be filthy. It was 9am in the morning and clearly they had not done a thorough job of cleaning overnight. There was trash lying around on the side of the pool and some used cups etc. I really urge the hotel to train the staff to take the initiative to do someâ€¦",Aug-20,,

Check-in was seamless. I queued for maybe 10 minutes with 4 counters open. When it reached my turn, I guess the ""delay"" in checking in was to book the pool/gym/breakfast slots because that will take a couple of minutes per check-in.  2. Our birthday occasion came with a cake that came at turndown. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the generous size and quality of the cake. The cake might look small but it is tall, and between 2 pax, we had trouble finishing it. The cake was a chocolate mousse cake thingy with mango (I think) inside and raspberry coated layer outside. Fantastic.  3. Pool was crowded with families but finding seats was not anâ€¦",Nov-20,,

It really made a difference as the only â€œtripâ€ we made this year, and with all the restrictions etc. We are locals btw, and did not at all experience some of the incidences in some reviews. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and really like the location for being away from the more crowded places of Sentosa, and yet those places are a bus-ride away - as it really felt like a vacation away from the rest of what this year has been.

At the breakfast at the Kitchen Table, despite our relatively small order, the staff had kindly asked us if we wanted more food. Another staff later came up to our table to ask us if we wanted any other drinks (despite having ordered a cranberry and orange juice already). Really great service staff at Kitchen Table who looked into our â€œwell-beingâ€ which enhanced our staycay experience there.

Due to the travel curbs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, I took this opportunity to do a staycation in my own country, Singapore, in the Marvelous Suite with Escape for Two package (includes $50 dining credit and a bottle of champagne).  1.

It is a time to unwind, relax and enjoy the service of a 5 star hotel. Unfortunately, this short stay lacked the magic and customer service I have experienced previously at the W Sentosa and other Marriott Hotels. Firstly, check in was easy, however, we arrived at a time when there was not many people there. Half an hour later and there was a long queue and people complaining (loudly) about having to wait. There was also no priority queue for members, which was surprising. As a Titanium member I was upgraded to a room with a balcony, which was a nice touch as I understand the hotel is pretty full.

Quick access to the waterfront marina Boardwalk nearby.

However, being one of the few hotels in SG that could afford a truly vacation-like experience, W is evidently immensely popular amongst vacation-starved locals, and as a result, is fast becoming a victim to its own success. Rates have increased considerably (even higher than pre-COVID rates), but service and housekeeping standards have paradoxically dropped; essentially, it feels like you are paying more for less.  The view of our marvelous suite (room 562) was breathtaking and I would gladly rebook this room again in a heart beat. We were somewhat disappointed that we could not enjoy ourâ€¦",Nov-20,,

There's like about 5 guys at the door entrance. Everyone just LOOK at us without offering any help. When I almost open the door myself, a guy 50/50 open the door for us. All he mentioned was ""proceed there to take ur temp and go level 2"". THATS IT. just 1 guy said ""Welcome"". So both of us ended up carrying all our luggage and bags ourself up to level 2.

So my recent stay at the W Sentosa came as a surprise. The hardware was excellent - big rooms (Fabulous rm), nice balcony (facing the pier), decent gym (tho 1 of the 2 treadmills was broken and they are using 1990s eqt), wonderful room service dinner (chicken masala was outstanding).

Breakfast time slots had to be pre-booked and unfortunately I was left with the 6-8am time slot. Pool was also always packed.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,(Almost) perfect staycation,"First of all, I want to commend the staff on making all of the Covid-related restrictions not too onerous and for managing our stay (almost) flawlessly. One incident happened at check-in this past Saturday when one of the guests refused to wear his mask when approaching the check-in desk, and was rude to the staff. The front desk did not get flustered but diffused the situation with grace and elegance - very well done.  We had a small issue with room service where we ordered breakfast which was delivered after 55 minutes and with the wrong items. Overall the room service food quality was sub-par but there are a couple of breakfast places within less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

W hotel is very popular, and thanks for our booking done months before, we got a good price for the rooms. My friend booked the suite, I booked the room with the balcony. We stayed all 5 of us. One thing for sure is that this hotel is immensely popular, the check-in queue was a good indication. Check-in staff were friendly, though she gave me wrong info which caused a bit of tension in the pool (regardless of the day, you need to reserve pool spot - the front desk lady said no need booking on weekday). Rooms were... not impressive. We could not dim the lights in the suite living room. Itâ€™s either too bright or completely off. Asked the housekeeping lady to help, she toldâ€¦",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,2,COVID-19 Times Staycay Not for Us,"We discovered at check-in that we had to make reservations to use the gym, the spa, for the breakfast buffet and to use the pool. The pool was the biggest letdown for us as guests are limited to a 2-hour use a day. The main reason we did a staycation was to lounge at the pool and get poolside service.  We would have been less miserable using our own condo pool and facilities. We wish we had been preempted on all those restrictions prior to booking our staycay.  We checked out one day earlier than intended because we were very uncomfortable. We checked out 2 hours after standard check-out time of 12pm and were charged half a dayâ€™s rate. Thatâ€™s fine but how about instead of charging about $750 a night (after taxes), W charges way less for a room and get guests to pay for pool,â€¦",Aug-20,,

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,2,Disappointing staycation as a Marriott Platinum Member,"This is a review for a two-night staycation.  Check-in Experience: 1. I am a Platinum member and was debating whether to book a normal room using points and request for a suite using my suite awards, or to pay for a suite room instead. I ended up booking the marvelous suite with $ so I would be guaranteed a suite room at check-in. 2. When we  checked in at 5pm on Friday, the front staff desk said ""We've upgraded you to a marvelous suite."" I was confused because I didn't specifically ask for an upgrade and this was also the room type I recalled booking. The staff then double-checked the computer and apologized.

He got our access cards ready the instant the room was made up. Following which he ensured that everything was in working and good order before he took his leave. He checked in on us and made our stay very comfortable. Excellent service, keep up the good work!",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Apr-20,5,Great stay,"I stayed a night at W Hotel, the last Saturday of March. It was fantastic, from the view from the balcony, to the comfort of the bed and most importantly - the hospitality of the hotel team. Check in was smooth, thanks Nadia for being attentive to our needs. Also to the guy at SKIRT when we were there from 5 to 6pm, and whom we met again the next day at breakfast, sorry I didn't get your name, I only know he was from Banquet team - thanks for making sure we were always in good hands. Look forward to staying with W Hotel again",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,4,Great stay in nice surroundings,"We were very happy about our stay in W hotel. Room was really nice with balcony towards the pool and marina. Clean, good beds and enough space for our small family. Only small complaints come about noisy a/c and not very appealing hotel bar with loud music all day. Cocktails were good though. Area is very nice and there are many restaurants just around the corner by marina.",Jan-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Perfect Wedding and Staycation,Had our wedding at W hotel and was excellently attended by Jess (our wedding coordinator) for the event. Special mention also to Daniel (the event coordinator) that was excellent and Wai Meng (our kind butler for that day) who was super meticulous to help us in any way possible. Great service by W hotel! And would recommend anyone who would like to hold an event there! Also had a great and relaxing staycation thereafter as well as a beautiful dinner at Skirt. Highly Recommend!,Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,3,Staycation during Covid,"We have just finished a 1 night staycation in the W Sentosa. We had a lovely relaxing time. The staff were all fantastic and we had great service throughout. Especially at the restaurant Skirt. Breakfast was excellent and plenty of variety. Much better than the other hotel that we stayed the night before - in Sentosa island as well. The only thing that turns me off - cleanliness of the pool. It was super dirty and within half an hour, we decided to head up for a shower. Other than that, it was still an enjoyable stay in the hotel.",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Birthday Staycation,"We booked 2night stay, Fabulous Room pool View with Balcony.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Birthday Stay,"A very unforgettable experience. Stayed for mine & hubbyâ€™s birthday. Booked Away Room with Plunge Pool for 1 night.  I ordered a cake outsource in advance to be sent to the hotel so that it will be ready during my stay. Everything went smooth. They even provided an additional cake with compliments from the hotel.   Not only that, they gave us a free upgrade to Fantastic Suite. Even gave balloons & a birthday card on the bed! ðŸ˜  The hotel ambience overall was great, peaceful, very posh. The hotel signature fragrance was really nice. Gave us a really out of d norm experience.   A little pricy tho. But worth the price! Would love to plan for a stay there again.",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,4,Christmas Stay.,"Stayed here over Christmas and had Christmas day brunch with a bunch of people. Hotel and enviorons are fantastic although we found the bar service a bit slow, music was a bit too loud - even during the day - or perhaps I am getting old.  The hotel did not appear to be particularly ""christmassey"" but the crowd we were with made it ok.  Otherwise , restaurant, food and general service was very good. This was our 2nd December stay at the W so perhaps we will try elsewhere next time.  Rooms were good with views over the pools and on into the distance.",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Darius,Nadia Choi is very patient and provide very good advice to me during my stay. She went extra mile to help me and my friends eg. Asking what we need and she will try to provide us. Highly recommended to stay with W Hotel,Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,staycation,"Visited W hotel with my friends for 30th birthday Celebration. Check in was long queue, however, service staffs was friendly.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Best hotel in Singapore,Had a fantastic time in Sentosa Cove. Vibrant atmosphere. Amazing decor and courteous staff. Highly recommend for staycation. The swimming pool attached to our room was excellent. Aquarium and all the beaches are nearby!,Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,5,Staycation for a friend's birthday done right,"We had an amazing time at W Sentosa - from the welcome, upgrade, amenities, food and late check out. Time at the pool was rewarding. The team at breakfast even provided us with coffee/tea to go. Kudos to the team and special thanks to Fazila and Agnes. The service from Nasir via room service was really warm too. Thank you all for giving us a chance to relax - truly a memorable stay. Will recommend at all costs!",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Wonderful Time,"We loved our time here! It was a business/family trip, and made everyone happy. We have 4 young children, and it was easy for me to take them to play at Sentosa or stay and play in the pool.  Great food and great accommodating staff.",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,4,Compliments to hotel service staff Wai Meng,"Always look forward to going back to W Hotel Singapore as I'll get to meet the excellent service staff Wai Meng.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Great service,"Great staycation thanks to the staff - Vijay is a fantastic manager Abd looked after us extremely well. Weâ€™ll be back, a good break during tough times. Love that the pool is open 24/7 and the newly renovated bar is very good",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,5,Fantastic,"What a great hotel. Facilities and amenities are great. Room was serviced daily with no complaints from us. All staff were accommodating, polite and extremely helpful. Has a great and punctual free shuttle service to get around island. Pool area is extremely clean and accommodates more than ample seating to use.  Will definitely return as it has a very calm and relaxing ambience.",Jan-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,5,Great service and amazing stay!,"Being an avid staycationer, I am happy to say that my time in W Singapore Sentosa Cove is one of my most enjoyable experience to date. This was our first staycation since circuit breaker to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. Check in was fast, rooms are clean and well designed. Service was especially top notched, special mention to Agnes, W guest services manager for ensuring our stay was nothing short of amazing and memorable. Thank you W Singapore! I will be looking forward to staying there again.",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Great!,"We stayed here on our honeymoon - they made it super special! Wanted to give a shoutout to Weihao who was our point of contact, she went above and beyond! When we arrived, they had arranged a honeymoon care package and flower petals on the bed. For the hotel itself, the pool is great, itâ€™s in a nice secluded location but not too far from downtown. If youâ€™re a runner, Sentosa has good running paths all around. Thanks for an unforgettable experience!",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Get away in Covid times,"This is my fourth stay at the W and I remember why I will keep coming back as it is the brilliant customer service that blows me away and quality of facilities every time.  Despite covid, everything has run like clock work from the check procedure to pool and gym allocated times and Resturant books.  It was so lovely of the Director of Operation Robert Conte to come past our table at Skirt (highly recommended Resturant) to greet us and ensure we were having a wonderful experience.  Till next time",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Much better than I expected,"Honestly, I had low expectations.  Have had dinner at Skirt previously and the hotel gave a tour bus group feel vibe.  And that may be the case when no zombie virus to scare foreign tourists.  But on my wkend visit (probably 30% occupancy), they impressed.  Room was excellent (balcony facing boats/water, good size), gym was pretty good (some broken eqt), room service was tasty and efficient, and the huge (I mean huge) pool with slide. Breakfast was impressive both food wise and service.",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,4,Excellent resort for families but far from main Sentosa attractions,"We stayed at W for 3 nights as a family of 4, the 2 double bed Wonderful Room is definitely enough for our needs. Our kids (4 and 7) had a great time on the swimming pool. It is well managed and just the right height for them to swim and play water. Also the pool was not crowded at all, so they have a lot of space.   The breakfast is fantastic and has variety of options including Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Western. I loved the original honey comb used for getting honey.   The only issue is that W is far from the main Sentosa attractions and whilst there is a regular bus to the main Bus Depot/beach, it does take time to get there and then transfer to other bus to Resort World etc.",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,5,Wonderful Staycation at the W Singapore!,"Had a wonderful 3D2N stay at the W. Managed to stay at the Marvellous Suite facing the marina and the pool. The kids enjoyed the pool facilities despite it being 2 hour blocks. The breakfast spread was also nice, but I expected to have a wait a little longer as it was an ala carte buffet breakfast due to the covid 19 measures. No complaints as can understand the difficulty for the resort. Staff at the restaurant were still very nice despite being so busy.  The room was clean and the kids enjoyed the jacuzzi in the bathroom with its own TV! Looking forward to another staycation soon at the W!",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Amazing hotel!,"Loved this hotel! The location was awesome and the service was just perfect. Lamont Lan was so helpful when we checked in and had a very calming nature about him that we loved! He is definitely an asset to your team. Nicky was also very helpful...he was very patient and answered all of our many questions. JS in concierge was so pleasant, welcoming and courteous.  Thank you to W Sentosa....we loved staying at your hotel!",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Amazing Anniversary Staycation,"Had a fabulous stay and time at W Singapore - Sentosa Cove for our Anniversary. Been a long time since we travelled and we had alot of fun for this short trip. Cherry, Welcome Experience Officer, did a really amazing job of organising and decorating the room. The room has a nice view of the pool and marina. The quiet and peaceful surrounding is perfect for a some time away from busy Singapore. We were so happy with our trip that we are booking the next trip with another Marriott property 2 months later!",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,3,Standard has dropped,"My family used to love staycations at W Singapore. However, this current trip had disappointed us. Service was less prompt (I had to call a few times at different intervals before someone finally picked up my call). I also found a bar of soap at the entrance of the toilet area. How could this be missed out during housekeeping before the next guest arrived? I believe there are many nicer hotels in Sentosa to visit for consumers to choose from.",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Wonderful place we will be back for sure,"My Wife and I visited Sentosa for the first time this year, and we both have really enjoyed our stay at W Marriott Sentosa. It was the first time we experienced the W from Marriott and were not disappointed. The whatever whenever concept is very clever. From Checking in to checking out, the service was well above average and consistant,  I could not fault it if I tried. Very good recognition of the Bonvoy Program. The location is fantastic and from there you have many attractions close by. Our stay was very quite, very comfortable and very relaxing. I enjoyed watching the boats at the marina, the pool and the food. The pool was very attractive, refreshing and designed for total relaxation with massages chairs in the water, a massage fountain, wet bar and it was well catered withâ€¦",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,3,Staycation,"Did a staycation with family in this hotel after hearing a lot of good feedbacks.   Pretty disappointed with the breakfast on the local food. They do have any taste of the SINGAPORE, may it be the laksa or the nasi lemak.   Service overall is good but still have room for improvement like a room near to Room Service entrance has a lot of beeping when they enter and exit. Worse if they donâ€™t even close if properly. It beeps all the way.",Jan-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,5,Favorite brand forever,"Have a wonderful stay in W Singapore with friends. No matter how busy they are, they always provide fabulous service for guest. Thank you, Tiffany and Wai Hoe arrange a nice room for me and my friend as well as Wai How handwritten welcome card and fruit bowl. Will definitely go back :)",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,Exceeded expectations for Staycation,"We were concerned about how enjoyable the stay would be given recent negative reviews and covid restrictions but all proved unfounded. The W team are just great from reception to pool to restaurants talent and deliver with a smile and warmth. Everything was managed perfectly with great poolside service of loungers, food and beverage. Likewise for the breakfast service which was delicious and efficiently delivered. Great talent service again at Skirt restaurant. And all of this wrapped up in SG clean procedures which made us feel very comfortable. Bottom line it was the staff talent which excelled and made this a brilliant stay with a return staycation from us guaranteed. Great also to see visibility of managers and the GM continuously greeting and checking on quests. Highlyâ€¦",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,Good option of Staycation,"having a great stay of my staycation with W hotel. Note that many of their staff are not able to go back to Singapore currently but in general, the service was good under this situation.   Floor 4's balcony view is mostly blocked by super-tall palm trees if your room is facing the poolside.   Fail to upgrade to suite by using suite-award during weekday check-in. Hopefully, the next stay can get upgraded successfully.   Specially thanks to JEVONS ANG :)",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Exceptional Service,"Well rejuvenated weekend! Special shoutout to Mr Lin Wai Hoe for the arrangements for our rooms, knowing that the reservation was for one of my friendâ€™s belated birthday gathering. We enjoyed ourselves a lot!   Not to forget the check in agent, didnâ€™t manage to get her name but found out that she is an intern - Thank you for the attention to details, knowing that I reached the hotel after ending night shift. She was thoughtful enough to arrange me an early check in to rest first, and deferred the room setup for the birthday celebration.   Would also like to thank Sherlene for attending to all my requests via mobile chat and arrangement to make reservation at SKIRT restaurant!   Kudos to W Singapore Team! You guys are just amazing!",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Wife's Birthday,"We stayed in the fabulous room for 2 nights.Reception was very accommodating and friendly. Had breakfast at kitchen table. Great menu plus service.Had the chance to try the steak at Skirt Steakhouse. Fully recommended. Had the Butcher's cut skirt steak. Very flavourful on its own.For those who expecting typical sides for the steak you will be disappointed as sides need to order on its own but recommend to try the olive oil mashed potato..very luxurious. Tried also the homemade ricotta served with baguette...very refreshing taste to start off.Service was tip top.Shoutout to Mr Edmond,Mr Maran,Ms Maria,Mr Rahul and all the chefs for the great food and hospitality given throughout our dinner especially a special celebration for my wife.Keep up the gold standard!Will definitely comeâ€¦",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,3,Back again after almost 6 years,"As we could not travel overseas so we decided to take a weekend staycation at W Sentosa Cove and this is the 2nd staycay after 6 years.   Hotel service is nice and staff are friendly but the place may need some refurbishment, feels a tad old - pool toilet has broken door handles, toilet floors was dirty, spectacular room carpet needs washing, and the TV in room 356 didnâ€™t have audio (but we didnâ€™t bother to ask technician repair since hotel said they ran out of HDMI cable so we didnâ€™t use the TV).   The cleanliness is good especially during this pandemic times. Overall still an ok hotel if you want a staycay.",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Superior holiday trip!,"Nice and great decorated hotel at calm Sentosa cove. Spend there 4 nights with my 4 people family. All of us liked much about pool, room with balcony and nice view at 5th floor. Pool service was great and food@drinks also super. Great B line free bus and shuttle bus to Vivo City shopping mall was free too, excellent service while hotel is not so center place at Sentosa. Good restaurants near by also.",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Excellent hospitality and Delicious food at WooBAR!,"Nice new decorations for WooBar. Visited on 9March, it gives us a totally different feel of the place compared to previously. We love it more now! Tried their new menu by chef TJ, the food was simply amazing (especially the salmon sashimi) and the service was absolutely perfect! The red wine was a great way to end our evening also. Kudos to Chef TJ and Shafeera for ur professionalism as well as being so patient with us and attending to all our needs. We will definitely be back again!",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,WONDEROUS experience,W HOTEL seems to portray more to the younger and couple crowd on the surface but it is actually a family friendly hotel too.  We had a great time here from check in till check out. From the Concierge to Front office to Housekeeping team were all very friendly.  The Experience Team Cherry did a great job of giving a birthday surprise and coloring set for my kid.  Some points to improve on:  - I was charged for the Pre authorisation deposit -The writing table chair's legs in the room will get in the way when walking.  Maybe staff can be given name tag in addition to the W pin thus better recognition can be given to them.,Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Wonderful service by manager Sietze,"We stayed for 2 nights in March for a family staycation. On the last morning our son had a medical emergency at the hotel restaurant, the staff and manager Sietze attended to us immediately. They were extremely kind in rendering their assistance in every way possible, including extending our checkout time and checking on us while we were at the hospital. Rest of stay was wonderful as well with prompt and attentive service throughout. We have been here a number of times and enjoyed each stay, but this one really made us feel W Hotel goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome. Highly recommended and we will definitely be back! Thanks again to Sietze and his staff :)",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,"Staycation at W Sentosa Cove, Singapore from Sun 20 Dec'20 to Wed 23 Dec'20","I, my wife and teenage daughter stayed at W Sentosa Cove for 3 nights from Sun 20 Dec'20 to Wed 23 Dec'20. We stayed in Room 534 with a balcony and pool view. We found our staycation to be perfect with the right ambience at the hotel. The service staff were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay. This is one hotel I would want to bring my family back to again and again. I would like to single out Wai Meng, Sunny and Darren from the Kitchen Table for their excellent service, friendly disposition, very good food recommendations and superb attention to our needs. It is service staff like Wai Meng, Sunny and Darren that brings W Sentosa Cove to the next level of excellence. Kudos to W Sentosa Cove for your service par excellence!

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,May-20,5,Our favourite pick in Singapore,"I have been to this hotel many times.  Both on business trips as well as with my family. It is our top pick in Singapore.  The distance to the city/business center is nothing compared to the value of the location. You enter a relaxed paradise outside of a busy city life. The service and food is great, the neighborhood is perfect for a walk and outside dinner.  The only deficit is unfortunately the fact that there are no children facilities, such as a kids club. But the great pool makes this up!  Looking forward to coming back!",Nov-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,"Fantastic stay at W, truly felt like a getaway","We had a blast at W Singapore. They take really good care of their guests. Every interaction from check-in, drinks at the bar, relaxing by the pool, breakfast to checkout was extremely pleasant. Seems like there were a good amount of families as well and noticed a number of fun initiatives like mega floats by the pool. Felt very safe, relaxed and canâ€™t wait to be back! Thanks team!",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,5,"Perfect Stay, Excellent Service","Beautiful room, great for a quick rejuvenation over the weekend. The stay was comfortable. Services over the front desk were professional - Jim assisted with a quick and smooth check in and accede to our request of an early check in. Great service! I was also pleasantly surprised with the birthday setup in the room. It was an overall pleasant stay in W Hotel and I would surely return!",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,4,Lovely break but limited vegetarian options spoils it,"After my terrible experience at Beach Villas (see my other review), W Hotel was a breath of fresh air. Like going from a tent to a real hotel!  The service was excellent, quick, efficient, helpful and friendly.  The room and views are lovely. The pool cold but great.  The living room and bathroom are epic spaces to enjoy, do work and have fun.  The only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is the complete lack of anything vegetarian or plant based protein on the food menu from The Kitchen Table.  Their version of vegetarian is 3 salads and pasta/pizza, that's it!  They have 11 main course dishes, none of which are vegetarian or even can be converted to vegetarian.  Where's the plant based protein alternatives? You're the W Hotel, supposed to be aiming at world aware eco friendly andâ€¦",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Weekend Staycation,My daughter booked a room for us on my sixty year birthday . That was six year ago. This time we stayed as platinum elite guests. The service was great plus we get unlimited drinks during happy hours at the bar. The hotel is still immaculate and modern. We were not expecting full occupancy because of Covid-19 but it was school holiday and Singaporean flocked to Sentosa for staycation. The queue for breakfast was incredibly Long. Over at the Sangrila it was like a ghost town according to my son. There are many attractions in Sentosa so staying at W hotel makes sense. We visited universal studio and adventure Cove and had a very good time even though we are a rather old couple but mobile. Overall a great stay but if you want a quieter stay booked a weekday stay outside the localâ€¦,Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,4,Nice staycation experience,"First time renting a suite here. It was a great experience to have a last floor corner suite to enjoy the view. This made our stay, looking at the see and the boats in the marina in the same time than having a view on the business district. Skirt restaurant was good as well as breakfast. Service was fast. I just do not understand why the bar is closed as well as the pool bar, while other 5 stars hotels in Sentosa have their bar and pool service open.  To be noted that the pool water and pool restroom was a bit dirty.",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,4,Wedding Anniversary - W was an amazing host,"We had planned to be on staycation ( chose W over St.Regis)  and planned a night stay for our wedding anniversary. While the plan initially was to stay without kids, there were some changes such that we had to take our kids with us. Great service from W on several grounds:  1. I called in 24 hours before check-in. Surely being a Gold member helps but still was so humbled that W team accomodated an upgrade to allow our kids to stay at no additional cost.  2. When we checked-in, we were greeted really well and there was a lovely cake when we came back from the pool.   Have now booked my parents for their weddiing anniversary on 7th Jan. Hope they have a great experience.",Nov-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Birthday Staycation,We booked the Awat Suite to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday and never regret. Weihao who checked us in was friendly and professional. The suite comes with a nice pool and comfortable. Room amenities were in working condition and bed was comfortable. We ordered our breakfast the next day and Nasir who delivered them was very friendly! I would personally say that the staff in W Singapore are full of energy/chirpy whenever we came in contact with them. Kudos to the Management for having a great team! Definitely will make another trip for a great staycation. Thank you for the lovely birthday cake and hospitality!,Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! DELICIOUS! BEST POOL!,"Initially I didn't expect this much fun at W Singapore. The hotel turns out to be a heavenly paradise with lots of fascinating experiences. I traveled with my son and he also enjoyed his stay, especially the pool.. the giant water puddle and slide captured his heart.. he didn't want to leave. You can easily relax amidst the spacious room with plenty of sun light and a nature-filled view..  This is a go-to hotel if you are thinking of visiting Singapore and have a list of things to do in Sentosa, especially if you have kids. You might not want to leave the hotel during your stay though.",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,A remarkable getaway and recharge,"The venue was tucked away in a very cosy part of Sentosa with nice sea breezes and a quayside walk easily accessible. The hotel was decorated with lovely colors and art, staff were very warm and attentive to guests' needs. Overall the setting was energetic, yet intimate. The bar, in room dining and in-house restaurant were excellent. A big thank you to the staff. Definitely a great place to chill out and recharge. Wish I could have stayed longer/ come by more often!",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Great Experience,From start to finish this hotel knew how to put customers first making us feel extra special throughout our experience. The hotel is beautiful and well maintained. The best part about the hotel has to be the staff and we would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Nadia Choi for her extra special welcome during our stay she is truly born to be in hospitality! Looking forward to staying again!,Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,2,The hotel should change brand,"Not the usual W experience, avoid this place unless you love kids. Iâ€™m a Marriott Titanium member and got low recognition, despite an upgrade being agreed, it vanished during check in. Location is poor for all but local attractions on sentosa, getting back from Singapore was a hassle. Breakfast service was poor, coffee always took 10-15 mins but there was nothing self service. Food that we tried was ok but nothing compared to other places in town.",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,W is top notch!,Staycay-ed here a couple times and have always been blown away by the service. Fazila has been amazingly helpful in ensuring our stay was as pleasant as possible. Pools are now in 2 hour slots but itâ€™s plenty of time! (Weekdays) Breakfast provided has a good selection of dishes and are wonderfully prepared.,Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,Perfect staycation!,"We stayed over a long weekend celebrating my fiends birthday. The staff was amazing - our friend was greeted with birthday wishes, the room was decorated and there was even a cake with customized writing.    The facilities were managed well given the covid challenges - the pool was not super crowded, the spa was quiet and relaxing, the staff was friendly. All this with full occupancy.   The absolute highlight of our stay was Mr Nassir from IRD. He was serving us throughout the stay and by the time we left it felt like we knew him well!  I have over a decade of experience in travel industry and he exceeded all 5 star expectations. He made us laugh, he was proactive, made our bday girl feel special, arranged mimosas for room service along with our breakfast, helped us takeâ€¦",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Never fail to disappoint!,W Hotel Sentosa is my first go-to option whenever I need to get away from the bustling SG city. I'd practically stay in all room categories (except extreme Wow suite & Away suite) and each room has it's own magic.   This review is for the Away room which was really hard to book due to the limited rooms but it was a total different experience from the others.   Room was definitely clean as always and staff were absolutely amazing! The plunge pool was amazing and we spent a full day in the hotel itself just lazing in the room and by the pool.   The breakfast is something you should never skip. It's amazing and room dining is also great. I noticed they recently change the menu as well!   Definitely this is some place you should never skip if you have more time in Singapore andâ€¦,Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,3,I don't understand the benefits of being a titanium member at this hotel.,"Clearly with travel restrictions we opted to stay at the w for a staycation of 4 nights. Whilst staff are very courteous and polite. I would say in all my stays at marriott across the world, this probably felt it didn't matter whether you hold an ambassador or titanium membership, everyone got the standard service. My suite request was denied, not sure what upgrade we got from what we booked, we got some coupons for free drinks, but nothing extraordinary. My first stay at a marriott in singapore and it probably dosnt come close to the service I receive from other marriott hotels across apac. I don't think I would consider staying here again, I have been way too spoilt at all the other marriott hotels.",Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,Short break,"Booked an Away room and was pleasantly surprised with the room.The room was surprisingly huge.As it comes with a private pool, this room is perfect for couples. The only downside is that there is no view as it blocked by the bushes. Be warned, the water can be very cold if you decide to have a dip at night. The bathroom is pretty huge with double sinks.  We ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room and service was fast and efficient. Food was excellent too.  For those who seek privacy and ultra chic room, this hotel is for you. It is quite a distance from the main attractions in the island but I think there is a shuttle bus for it.  Overall, the staff at the hotel are extremely polite and are very efficient in their duties. Will come back for sure.",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Best Hotel in Singapore! Really WONDERFUL Suites!,"W Sentosa never fail to make special occasions memorable! Impeccable service and a 6 star hotel in one of the most prestigious locations in Singapore.   This hotel is very stylish, modern yet whimsical, blended with luxury and class. Hands down one of the best hotels!  The beds are the most comfortable!!! Showers are the best in any hotel in the world.   Swimming pool is 24 hours so after all the hustle and bustle, it is very enjoyable to just chill by the pool in the wee hours at night.",Jan-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,2,W is not so Wonderful after all,"Supposed to check in on the 25th of November. But got rejected as our family had 5 persons. (2 adults and 3 kids age 10,6,4), they asked to book another room. Does not want to listen to our explanation. Insist that we book another room if we want to stay at the hotel. The hotel policy is rubbish. So we had to find another hotel in downtown to accommodate our staycation.",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Nice staycation!,"I read so many negative reviews about this hotel recently but we do not encounter any issue for our first stay. As a titanium member, my room was upgraded, despite the hotel was almost sold out during this school holiday period. Check in was totally a breeze. Robert, who is the Director of Operations came to speak to me while I was waiting to check in. He gave me his business card and explained their challenges in implementing safety measures during this Covid pandemic. Breakfast was great and all staffs were very helpful. Booking of facilities like gym, pool, steam room, was just a phone call away. For Marriott elite members, they offer happy hours, unlimited drinks, from 5pm to 7pm every day! Hotel location is right next to the Marina. Car park is free. My family is very happyâ€¦",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,2,Disappointing,"My wife and I spent 1 night in W for a staycation. The experience is quite disappointing in terms of service. We needed to book a 2 hours time slot for the pool, which we did at our arrival. The booking was not made when we went to the pool. We booked the Skirt restaurant at the hotel for 7.30pm, they called us in the afternoon to confirm the 1st available table was at 8.30 pm. When we arrived, the restaurant was half empty and our reservation was not made. The service was long and the food really overpriced. Most of the staff were nice except 1 at the pool that almost scolded us because my 8 months pregnant wife and I took a shortcut to reach the safe entry check point from the restaurant, instead of taking a lift up, walk through the whole lobby, take a lift down and walk....â€¦",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Excellent Overall experience,"I would like to express my most sincere appreciation to guest relation manager Mr Aldrin Mauricio from W Hotel Singapore at Sentosad Cove.   I had known Mr Aldrin in the year 2016 when i first booked my first stay at W Hotel Singapore and due to his sincere and genuine attitude, i would keep coming back to book a stay whenever i need a small getaway in Singapore.  Mr Aldrin was very patience with my requests despite some of my fussy requirement, He also never failed to make special and surprise arrangement for my special occasion spent at W Hotel.   He would always surprise me with complimentary gift like full size cake, standard bottle of red wine & free breakfast voucher for two and several cocktail vouchers.  I recently returned my stay to W Hotel again and he personally madeâ€¦",Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,Unforgettable Birthday @ W,"It was not a mistake to book the W! Just so coincide with my bestie's name initial ""W"", hence, I decided to book it for our 34th birthday celebrations! We were being served by a very observant and dedicated young man(sorry forgot your name! And thank you!), he soon noticed that it's my bestie's birthday and mine 2 days ago, while he was checking us in. So, we were later surprised by a cake and balloons in our room with a personalized note! The harbor view was gorgeous no matter it's sunset, night lights or the sunrise. Rooms were very fancy, with different colour mode to choose from. It was so comfortable that we almost just wanted to spend our whole time in-room. However, it was a hard wrestle as we all know that W has great facilities. We made use of the gym that whole night,â€¦",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,2,Dissatisfied with value for money,"Yes was a nice hotel and good customer service but any extras very overpriced.  Absolutely no alcohol in the cocktails by the pool, I actually couldnâ€™t believe they could be so blatant as to serve the cocktails that u were lucky if they had 1/8 a nip of alcohol in, absolute ripoff.  Also ate at the resort restaurant and again no alcohol in the cocktails and wine and bubbles are so overpriced you wouldnâ€™t bother.  Also understand that the $450 that gets deducted as a placeholder from your credit card when you check in is actually charged to your credit card.  When I asked front office they advised it was a miscommunication and it will be refunded in 2 weeks, a completely different story to when I checked in.  Definitely not value for money and would not recommend.",Dec-19,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Perfect Sunday Champagne brunch with great pool,"We celebrated a friend birthday with their Sunday champagne brunch and we are served with the great team, particularly Wai Meng who is so attentive to her guests.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,5,Rooms are stunning as well as the views,"I am a huge fan of the W, I think that the rooms are always modern, chic, and have that appeal. Whether you're a working professional, or you're on a couples trip, I love the fun interior and design of this hotel. During my stay they hosted pool parties in the day with live DJs. Our balcony was very spacious and we had the view of the pool which was quite nice. The restaurants were spectacular and their breakfast buffets had plenty of options. Service at the hotel was also top notch. I would 10000% return, you get wayyy more than what you pay for imo.",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Wonderful Retreat,"W Hotel @ Sentosa Cove is an ideal getaway in view of current pandemic situation. The surroundings and views exude a feeling of being away from home and out of Singapore. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful.   The yacht, sea view and quayside restaurants make the place unique and welcoming. Every restaurant is special in its own ways. The quality of food and ambience are very good. Being a local Chinese, I feel that the service may be lacking as some service staff seemed to favour the foreigners. In terms of getting a table, ordering and asking for the bill. Anyway, itâ€™s their attitude and we just choose another restaurant for our next visit. Overall, itâ€™s a wonderful experience and also the ability to watch sunset.",Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,1,Worst W Iâ€™ve stayed at,"Iâ€™ve stayed at many W hotels, from LA to Taipei to HK (list goes on) and I must say the Singapore W is categorically the worst managed W hotel of the bunch. The check in experience was terrible as the lady scrambled to pull up my booking from Amex. Room service ran out of mozzarella and when I ordered Caesar salad (I asked for dressing on the side) I found the dressing on the salad and the egg on the side. Iâ€™ve only been in the room for two hours. I canâ€™t wait to see what other surprises await. Note: None of this is a language problem , I speak fluent English and Mandarin",Feb-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Always Wow staycation,"Been regular for the past few years, but this is first time this year.  Was apprehensive at first, but the open nature of the room (stayed at Fabulous Room, & the Marvelous Suite) was so relaxing that I really enjoyed the short stay.  Plus:  nice views, closeness to nearly restaurants (Quayside Cove), Pool.  Minus:  Woo Bar is closed, Kitchen Table is in make-shift tents, buffets are not longer around.  Still a nice stay and the staff were wonderful, friendly and attentive - made the room special with the balloons!",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,Fantastic Family Time!,"Called in before I made the booking and spoke to a manager Weihao, heâ€™s so friendly and provided all the answers we need to our queries! He already made us feeling very positive for our upcoming stay!   Arrived and had Fiona to check us in and out, she is fabulous and made both our check in and out so quick and pleasant! We got our connecting rooms for the family and all the arrangement in per what we needed. The kids had such a blasting time by the pool and I have to say that they serve delicious pool side food, especially the char kway teow! But sadly, their pool no longer has those big lazy floats for adults to enjoy and now you have to pay for it! :(  Housekeeping was great too! When we called for stuff, the call center sends them promptly!   We tried the spa too and evenâ€¦",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Repeat staycation- great crowd control measures,"Thanks W Singapore for another memorable stay. Well done with the social distancing measures, cleanliness and the control of crowd at the common areas.  Booking of swimming pools were made at the time of check in. At dedicated time slots, each guests were identified via colour coded bands, which helped with identifying if anyone over stayed - truly a fair and smart way of controlling the Swimming crowd.  Well done W Singapore.",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Excellent After Service,"Went the kitchen table for dinner cum business discussion, even after a year after my wedding, Riduan made reservations and special arrangements for my discussion sitting so that we wouldnâ€™t be disturbed but yet still enjoy the food and service of the staff. Even on his off day he still took the effort to check whether The Skirt has availability for me. Riduan is someone who will go the extra mile to make sure he try accommodate to my request and always making me feel welcomed! He is someone Iâ€™ll always look forward to meeting whenever Iâ€™m there be it for staycation, spa or even food!",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Truly amazing,Very friendly staffs and good service.

Breakfast choices were limited but understandable due to covid. nonetheless they didn't compromise on staff.  Highly recommended hotel and will definitely return again.,Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,5,A 'wow' stay in W,"A 'wow' stay in W  The Great experience started even before the stay when the customer service promptly and patiently replied my queries on the facitilites and charges for kids.  The chocolates after efficient check in delighted the kids. The ice cream bands absolutely thrilled them.   The room with plunge pool is so convenient. They were in the pool for so long and refused to get out even their skins were crumpled.  Great staff with little touch on our birthday balloons, free juices for dine in orders and loanable dvd for kids to enjoy in the comfort of room.   Very very relaxing and happy trip overall. I kept hearing laughters from them. I believe it was a awesoms break from their child care school.  In fact, we are going back again this coming weekend.   Thank you, W",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,May-20,5,Best Service Ever,"To whom it may concern,  I am writing you to express my gratitude to all your team. They were all amazing from the moment I made the reservation until now, the post-stay. Me and my partner stayed at W Singapore in the beginning of March. We were planning to do a trip through Asia, so we left our bags in your hotel, thinking that we would be picking them up by the end of our trip.  Firstly, as soon as we made the request for you to keep the luggage, you said â€œyesâ€ immediately, without raisin any concerns. Secondly, our stay was fabulous! It was a short one-night stay, but it could not have been better. The hotel itself is just amazing! Also, we had a couple meals at the Kitchen Table restaurant and it was fabulous, along with all the staff. Unfortunately, we did not get anyâ€¦",Mar-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Mar-20,4,Staycation,"The hotel was modern, I have booked the room by using the point. When we checking in, we requested a room with the plunge pool which is available, thatâ€™s awesome. I got the room ready almost 3pm. When we entered to the room, we love it! Bed was comfortable, sound system and tv was good, pool was clean. Only small defect in the room, hopefully they already fixed it by now. Overall experience was great. However, from our staycation experience here, we should request a room far from the kids next time as our next door kid was screaming while used the pool all the time. Gym was nice, big spaces.",Mar-20,,

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,5,A Great Reprieve for those seeking an escape,Takes a little travelling to get to the Hotel located on the Southern end of the Island. But the friendly staff that greets you at the Hotel reminds you that you are here on vacation with a splash.   COVID-19 has led to restrictions in the hotel such as the pool and gym being capacity controlled but have never faced any issue to get such bookings done via the App.  Breakfast was another highlight opposed to what was received in other hotels. Quality food with prompt service.,Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Incredible pools and ambiance!,"First and foremost, the hotel is clean and has a pleasant fragrance as we entered our room. The bathtub and furniture are very modern-looking and new! Secondly, we LOVE the pools! There are a variety of pools (e.g. adult, children, baby, jacuzzi) which are kid-friendly and interactive with a slide for both children and adults. The staff at the pool area are very warm and welcoming as well! Thirdly, although the buffet spread isn't halal-certified, my family enjoyed the bakeries such as the pancakes, croissant and fresh toast accompanied by a scenic view of the yacht. Lastly, we love that there is a shuttle bus directly from our hotel to the beach station. Hence, convenient for us to move about.   However, we feel that the hotel rooms should have a bidet at their toilet.â€¦",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Excellent service and nice view,"After CB, I have stayed at a few hotels in Singapore but W hotel Sentosa is one of the best hotels that I have experienced.  The staff was friendly and prompt. They decorated a room a little bit and provided small cake and cute cards for my friend's bday - which made our day.   The swimming pool was specious enough so we didn't have any difficulties booking the slots even though there was a strict social distancing rule in place.",Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Over our expectations - once again,"A huge thank you and bravo to W Hotel Sentosa team who is always going the extra mile. They are doing their best to make you feel super good, despite the restrictions. Breakfast team is wonderful, pool team is wonderful, reception can sometimes do a bit better but they are the one who absorb most of the frustrations that can arise from realising the experience of course is affected by the situation. W Hotel staycation has been and will be helping our little family to maintain a certain level of sanity :-). We have just spent 2 nights this weekend and are coming back to work like we have been travelling to some far away place. We will be back soon ! Special kudo to May - always full of positive energy around the pool and at breakfast.",Oct-20,,

Staffs at the W were fantastic and there was always a smile on their faces.

As we celebrated our wedding anniversary at Skirt, the service was commendable.",Dec-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Great Stay at W Hotel,"The breakfast crew at the Skirt and Kitchen Table were great and attentive, making sure you needed everything and that food was okay. Wai Ming and her team were fun,  caring and friendly, making sure everyone was taken care of.   Check in crew were great too, ensuring check in process smooth.   Downside was the spa experience where service and facilities are not in par with other 5 star hotel.   Overall, A well rested and fruitful stay at W hotel.",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Feb-20,5,A Memorable Stay!,"I chose the W Singapore for my girlfriends 30th birthday celebration and it proved to be a sound decision. We stayed at the WOW Suite which certainly lived up to its name in terms of the space offered and the truly modern style that is consistent throughout the hotel.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,5,Excellent Service and Awesome Staff,Did a staycation with the family over the weekend and had a fabulous stay.  Check-in process was very smooth and a shout out to Tiffany for arranging our rooms.  Breakfast at the KitchenTable was very efficient with ample staff serving our orders with a wide variety of options to choice from.  Kudos to the staff @ the KitchenTable for the awesome service.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Sep-20,1,Congratulations on Ruining My 40th Birthday,"I wish I was writing to share a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, their Welcome desk gave me an incredulous welcome instead.  I booked a two night stay this weekend to celebrate my 40th birthday tomorrow - I'm sure most would agree that it's a big milestone, and hope that whoever reads this has better memories of their own 40th birthday than mine.  The first disappointment was when the front desk staff informed me that the latest checkout time he could provide was 1pm, instead of the Platinum guaranteed 4pm because the W Singapore is not a hotel but a resort. I can live with that, but would deeply appreciate if someone could elucidate what makes the property a resort. Is it just the location? There is no onsite beach, and not that many facilities really.  Anyway, what tookâ€¦",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,5,Truly a â€œoverseasâ€ vacation,"W Sentosa truly offered a great staycation experience unlike any other with its resort vibes and location.  We redeemed our Amex voucher and got a Fabulous room with balcony and pool view and we really enjoyed the space. Platinum members gets 2 welcome drinks which is delivered to the room and is a nice touch. They recently moved to a new bath amenity called momo which is nice too but I really missed the amenities from Bliss which really reminds me of Ws.  I had lunch and high tea at Kitchen Table and Dinner at skirt and really enjoyed the service and food.  What makes this property really exceptional is the staff and I like to highlight Holly and Fiona from Welcome Desk, Wai Meng, Q, Billie, Mollie and Catherine from Kitchen Table and Nicholas from reservations.",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Nov-20,3,Room for improvement,"Despite the high occupancy during my stay, overall service management at check-in/out, room services, pool, restaurant etc. were at good standard.  Two feedbacks: 1.  Overall breakfast food standard/service were acceptable. However, for 2 days in a row, the fruit plate served were not fresh. 2. In comparison to other 5-Star Marriott properties in the region, the treatment for a highest tier Marriott Elite member was unfortunately disappointing. Unlike the norm, the extra attention/effort to make us feel thoroughly at-home and special was missing prior and during the stay.",Nov-20,,

I was very impressed that when I checked out, I asked the staff at reception who was processing my check out for a wine cork replacer for my unfinished wine , she was so helpful that she walked to the bar at the same floor to get a new replacer for me.

You have to beg to get 4:00 pm, despite not running in full capacity. But a few times, when I did the check in, I have to wait until 4:00 pm one time, and another time 6:00 pm, because "" we have a guest platinum who is leaving late"" haha. I am one of them but I am allowed only 2:00 pm.  Second one, they are make construction which make a big noise, with trilling . Until 7:00 pm, and they start again at 9:30 am.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,5,Long awaited stay with assuring safe management measures,"Stayed over the first weekend that the initial batch of 5 hotels were allowed to accept staycation bookings. Expected the hotel to be packed but the measures put in place made the property feel very empty and relaxing. Thought that the safe management measures were implemented very well. The Away room was awesome, and located within the spa so access to the pool and the spa was made very convenient. Breakfast is now served as an ala carte buffet (have to call and book one of three possible slots) and the laksa was great (the Mee Goreng wasnâ€™t, though) Spa facilities are limited to a max of 10 persons so we had to call to book a time slot to use it, but it was usually quite empty.

The menu had a wide array of dishes, and we enjoyed all of them.  The pool was beautiful, and it was easy to book our two hour slot.  Given we were doing other activities around Sentosa, the two hour scheduling didnâ€™t bother us.  At the late afternoon, there were very few people there, making the experience very peaceful.  The staff at the pool were very friendly and attentive.",Aug-20,,

Looked out the window and all these idyllic yachts berthed by the dock.  Location is really more remote if you donâ€™t drive. Best to Grab from Vivo and save yourself at least 40mins on monorail + Bus B.   Many thanks to Holly at the front desk / reception for making our day. We had a small request which was turned down by another receptionist earlier in the day.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,1,Lackluster customer service,This review is for a stay before the circuit break/ pandemic.   Customer service at this hotel is slow and unimpressive.  1) Their spa discount stipulations for Marriot Ambassadors are unclear and their staff provide conflicting info even. in writing.  2) We had dinner at the steak house and my mom literally fell asleep waiting for the food to be served- it took Them more than 3.5 hours to complete our dinner service- this wasn't a 20 course meal. Very slow and nothing to write home about. 3) It took more than an hour for me to check out because of disputes with charges. My elderly parents had to wait in the lobby for an hour while we settled the spa dispute which I had in writing- I was horrified by how they treated a Marriott Ambassador.

My teenage daughter particularly liked all the different modes of lighting in the room, and loved the high quality speakers to listen to music.   Our room had two queen sized beds and had plenty of room for our family of three, together with a really great window ledge that was perfect for storing three large suitcases.   The grounds and pool area were immaculate... had it not been for the inclement weather, we would have spent a whole day relaxing by the pool.  There are multiple options for food and beverages.

Although the check in was a bit long as thereâ€™s many things to run through ie slot booking for spa, pool and gym, breakfast options etc, other than that the check in experience was perfect, but thereâ€™s a long queue right after my check in is done.

I dined at the restaurants for most meals.  The qualities were reasonable.  A restaurant staff (I think it was Miss Wee Meng) was very friendly and could remember names.  A welcoming place!   The massage was great!  Right point and not rushing at all.  The heated pool in the spa area  was my favourite place in the evening.  So relaxing!    There is a limit of people that can be allowed to the pool and spa areas.  The breakfast timing is staggered as well.  I like it this way; more privacy and safer.,Oct-20,,

When we could not check in early, they help prepared cards for us to use the facilities in the hotel first.

I had requested a room upgrade as a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member. The best they could do was either a Fabulous (room with balcony) or Away Room (with a plunge pool). I chose the Away Room, but regretted it as we barely used the plunge pool, and the room itself wasn't as nice as the Fabulous Room.  I was also told that despite being a Platinum member, I could only get either a room upgrade or a late checkout, unlike at other Marriott hotels where both would be offered.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jan-20,5,Wonderful Hotel With A Fantastic Set of Staff!,"My husband took me on a birthday staycation at the W Hotel! The staff were popping up with birthday surprises throughout our stay. We had the hi-tea set at Woobar (the savory snacks were lovely, the sweet desserts were nice but it was too much and we ended up not being able to finish a lot of it).   At dinner, we were also given a slice of cake to celebrate my birthday! We didn't tell them. We figured out that Front Desk had informed them and it felt like the service was seamless.  During turn-down service, housekeeping came and transformed our room into something different from when we checked in! They added pillows with the word ""LOVE"", dimmed down the lights and presented me with a birthday cake, a box of chocolates and balloons. It was so much fun!  We had such a wonderfulâ€¦",Jan-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,1,Disappointing is an understatement. Never again at W Singapore Sentosa.,"My recent stay at the W Singapore is without doubt the worst hotel experience i've ever had.   The W just looks like an overpriced 3-star hotel but with poor service and most disappointingly the hotel did not inform us at any time that there would be a tonne of restrictions during our stay until we were physically checking in at the front desk - which completely ruined the 'staycation'. Essentially guests  are only allowed to use the pool for 2 hours a day, which you had to make a reservation in advance + specific time bands for breakfast. The quality of the food and service was a let down.   I paid $900+ for 24 hours of complete frustration. Thank you. You really know how to piss off your guests. Never again; never again a staycation and never again a W.",Aug-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,3,No 5 star,"The GOOD: the premises are well maintained, we took the balcony pool view room and it was spacious. The hotel even managed a last minute room decor for us as it was our anniversary. The place is pretty close to the beach and they have buses to take you directly. Overall hospitality was good- at the reception, the ""whenever/whatever"" help desk and the staff were prompt to respond on requests. Proper measures were taken to avoid crowding in common facilities.  The BAD:  Some furniture in the room was broken/not working. There was a long queue for check-in which could have been managed better.  The UGLY: Ok, so we're in the room taking a nap and all of a sudden a guy walks in with a cake yelling room service. We were so lucky that both of us were just sleeping and it wasn't thatâ€¦",Nov-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,5,Fabulous staycation,"We recently took a 2 night staycation at W Sentosa to celebrate a special occasion and to try and create some holiday sensation amidst the prolonged travel restrictions. We selected an Away room so that we had a private plunge pool as the main pool is restricted to 2 hour booking window due to safe distancing requirements. When we arrived, there was a long queue to check in, but it was quickly and efficiently dealt with by the staff on the desks. The Away rooms are tucked away in a separate part of the hotel, so we were shown the way by the very helpful Rajes. We were surprised and delighted to see that our room had been decorated with balloons to mark our celebration, and a complimentary cake was delivered soon after, which was way above and beyond our expectations. â€¦",Sep-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Jul-20,5,Staycation on Covid Era,"We have just finished a 2 night staycation in the W Sentosa. We had a lovely relaxing time. The hotel has a cap of 50% capacity so it felt nice and quiet. The staff were all fantastic and we had great service throughout.  Breakfast is now a la carte and this in our view is an improvement as the food was all fresh. Breakfast was excellent and plenty of variety.  There was a limit of 100 pax at the pool at anyone time but they canâ€™t have been near this capacity so we we had uninterrupted enjoyment of the pool. The only thing that felt a big unusual was that due to virus there is no eating/ drinking (other than water) by the pool - so was a shame not to be able to have a soft drink, beer or ice team by pool. But it was a small sacrifice and in our view did not frustrate us tooâ€¦",Jul-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Oct-20,4,Nice weekend away,"Anecdotally fully booked every weekend by travel deprived locals. Thus, there was no expectation of an early or late check out and so did not ask. Was upgraded from base Wonderful to high floor Fabulous as Platinum, with profuse apologies that all suites were taken. (A check with the booking engine the night before confirmed this) Reservations required for pool and breakfast but that meant peace of mind and lack of crowds when it is your turn. Well appointed room, hardly showing its age and balcony was great for sunbathing. Platinum amenity of breakfast was volunteered with prompting, and waiver for 2 children welcome. Very well equipped gym with squat rack, kids loved the water slide.",Oct-20,,
W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Aug-20,2,Nice hotel but didnâ€™t blow us away,"We booked the Away room and the private plunge pool area was a highlight. It was very peaceful to lie on the sofa out there at night time and listen to the waves of the pool.  We got a bit unlucky with the timing in that WooBar was closed and The Kitchen Table was under renovation. Access to the main pool area was also limited to 2 hours per group per day to avoid overcrowding given the pandemic, and that contributed to the fact that the spa was fully booked for all 3 days of our stay so we missed out there as well. Skirt is a great restaurant though. Their steak is some of the best in Singapore.  We were disappointed to find a dead fly on the back of one of our pillows (I have decided not to add the picture here). After raising this concern to staff we were offered an apologyâ€¦",Aug-20,,

The service team also responded to our requests very promptly.  We would really like to commend the team at W Hotel. From start to end, the staff team went out of their way to make our stay special as a honeymooning couple and it was truly memorable.

W Singapore - Sentosa Cove,Dec-20,4,Staycation,"Together with what seemed like the whole of Singapore, we spent the weekend at this hotel to celebrate our kid's birthday.  Having stayed at the W Taipei recently where, as Titanium Elite members, we were upgraded to a huge suite, the Fabulous room was smaller and humbler by comparison. Room decor was surprisingly gaudy and lacked the cool sophistication one has come to expect of a W hotel. Service was good and the staff made accommodation to serve us breakfast in our room the first day as the makeshift hotel restaurant was not big enough to fit all guests.  Carpark was incredibly small and luckily the friendly valet was happy to help with parking.

We have given this hotel a few chances but I feel there are some serious changes that need to be made.  We are titanium members and did not feel very appreciated.  As part of a perk, you received 1 drink card per person, per day during the duration of your stay (instead of 2 hour daily free-flow drinks). I completely understand the reason for the change due to the new guidelines. However, we had to remind the staff everyday to bring our drink cards to our room. We decided to order a red wine, however we were informed that the hotel ran out.  Also, when we wanted to order in-room dining, they informed us they ran out of pizza (which was what we specifically wanted).  I find it very shocking that aâ€¦",Aug-20,,

After an hour, we only got 2 out of 4 orders (and many items they failed to bring were pre-cooked stuff like smoked salmon, yoghurt, and fruit). We were so fed up and famished we left. Told the front desk to cancel breakfast for next day, which they agreed. When I checked out, they promptly charged me for all the breakfasts.

On this, my second stay with W Sentosa, it was even more disappointing than the first. I will not go into details except to say that internal communications between the reservations, front desk and style teams ultimately had a ripple effect that reverberated throughout our stay. Made for a rather unpleasant experience. Marriott has completely ruined the former Starwood portfolio. Itâ€™s effects can be seen in some properties, unfortunately this is just one of them. The staff at breakfast and housekeeping are amazing and so helpful.

Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore,Dec-20,5,A welcome escape from the City,"Dusit holds a special place in my mind because of my fond memories of their Hua Hin location. Whilst the country remains on high alert for our safety, this was a very welcome and beautiful escape from the ordinary in Singapore.  The staff are very welcoming and befitting to Dusit. We had a minor check-in issue where our booking was not found but was swiftly resolved. Always served with a smile (or an assumed smile through the mask!)  The high ceilings and full height windows make the hotel feel very airy and open. And despite it raining later in our stay, you couldn't help but appreciate the amazing view you get.  One surprise for me as an aviation fan is the fantastic view you get of the traffic of planes flying in and out of Changi, with many vantage points around the pool area. For those looking to do a pure plane spotting session, I absolutely recommend the 'Pool View' rooms (not Patio, there are many trees in the way). be warned, however, that the ""City View"" rooms currently overlook a construction site (with the city in the backdrop)  While the rooms are not the biggest, it is fully equipped and wonderfully decorated. All toiletries are packed in individual paper sealed packages, has a rainfall shower, a Lavazza coffee machine and an array of cups and glassware.  In-Room Dining caught me by surprise by being one of the only hotels I have ever stayed in which do not charge a premium to dine in your room rather than in the dining hall. Just to test the service, we ordered Khao Niew Mamuang (Mango Sticky Rice/ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง)   The dining hall was beautifully decorated with an abundance of flora and has a view of both the poolside and the golf course which wraps the resort. The food was beautifully presented, in particular the steak on a hot stone! Mind you, we had to feed back that the steak as a little bit too salty but we hope this was a quick thing for them to resolve  Both the Pool and Gym were very pleasant facilities. The gym in particular is fully equipped with multiple treadmills, cycles, rowing, weights and pull up bars, as well as mats to do stretches/yoga. The pool has two Jacuzzi areas. There is also a kids pool and a 'relax' pool, which include loungers in the water.  During SG's Phase 2 measures, the hotel currently requires residents to wear masks in public areas, and booking a slot for the Gym (1 hour) and Pool (3 hours). In this early period, whilst very few were staying, this is simple enough, but be mindful when it gets busy.  Overall this makes a wonderful addition to the Dusit line-up and it definitely welcome to Singapore. Crazy as it sounds to open a hotel at a time like this, it was also exactly the type of hotel needed.…",Dec-20,,

Front counter staff said check in was anytime between 7am to 7pm. I hope I don’t have to wait another 3h to get my room. Excuse was need to clean rooms due to Covid. Take a lesson from MBS  - stagger check in with designated times! MBS was far more crowded but everything ran like clockwork. Or if unable to arrange staff to get rooms ready, don’t open!

My daughter was happy she has her own kiddie slipper as we had ours. They also have some complimentary drinks (2 soda cans and 2 bottles of juice in the mini fridge, bottled water and snacks. Also, we have complimentary tickets to the observatory.  The only sad…",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,We stay here for the pool and it did not disappoint,"We stayed here for one night to check out the infinity pool and it was fantastic, providing a great view of downtown Singapore and beyond. We arrived around 7AM and the staff was nice enough to give us an early check-in; the room was ready with our luggages at 10AM. The location was very convenient for us because it was right next to Gardens at the Bay and the Artscience museum is a one minute walk from the mall connected to the hotel. Unfortunately, we came during new year time and the price was extremely expensive. I can't remember spending so much for one night except at hot springs ryokans in Japan with full kaiseki dinner. I made the reservation on the hotel website, which had the lowest price with a price guarantee. If you plan to come often to this hotel, make sure you…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,4,Excellent view,"Stayed last year for my 50th Birthday booked the family room which was huge with large terrace.  The hotel foyer is a bit like an airport doesn’t feel like a hotel at all.  Check in was quick as don’t know whether it was because we had children with us but were taken straight to the VIP checking area were our bags were taken and were advised we could use the pool area until our room was ready.    The view from roof top pool is fabulous albeit the day we stayed was a bit overcast, there’s waiter service by the pool drinks and food quite expensive but we did expect that as Singapore is expensive.  Only booked to stay 1 night and then stayed in another Hotel for rest of holiday.  Booked room service for dinner which was outstanding lots of choice on menu for gluten free options…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Clean & comfy 5 stars hotel. Excellent service provided,"We had an enjoyable stay for 3 days 2 nights in MBS hotel.  The hotel room was very clean and comfy. The front desk and house keeping services are excellent as well. Whenever we need to Top some essential sundries and mAde a call to the front desk, they dissiminated the request to house keeping team promptly. The house keeper will delivered the items to our room shortly.  Currently all the towels in the bathroom were sealed up in plastic cling. At many times we had a hard time to tear off the plastic as its tightly wrap. I would suggest the house keeping team could prepare a pair of scissors for guests to use in room.  Overall, the services provided by hotel are excellent! Thumbs Up!",Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,Fantastic room with a great view,"We stayed here as part of our staycation over the October half term with our two children. It was a last minute decision but my husband managed to get a suite on the 52nd Floor. The suite gave us views on the marina as well as the view of the super trees, behind. Truly spectacular that even the children spent hours gazing at the view.  The rooms felt clean and spacious. Towels, cups and toiletries were in plastic coverings to show they have been covered after washing/sterlising.  For breakfast, we chose to eat at Spagio. They had a good selection of choices and were attentive to our needs.  Unfortunately, because we booked last minute, we were not able to book a slot to go and use the swimming pool.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Exceeded Expectations,"I was very impressed with the whole setup at MBS. We had booked a Club room, so could use the lounge check in. This was very efficient, and all the staff were not only wearing facemasks, but also face shields and safety googles.  Later we went up to the pool, and again this went smoothly. It may have helped that we were there mid week, so things were quieter,  we didn't have to queue for lifts, entrance to the pool, or Club 55. The pool was very quiet, we took the obligatory selfies, and had a swim as there were only about 10 people in the pool with us. Later that afternoon we went to Club 55 for drinks and some excellent food. The staff were friendly, very efficient, and constantly cleaning tables, chairs etc. We couldn't have dinner in any of the hotels  restaurants, as they…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Infinity and Beyond,"We choose a premier room and it was on a lower floor, the information I had was that the balcony view was looking out over the road.  Whilst that was true beyond the road was the Gardens on the Bay.  These gardens have a light show nightly we could watch perfectly from the balcony of our room. Our room was big in size, we had two double beds and a very well presented bathroom, shower and toilet. Our housekeeping lady was simply fantastic. What can I say about the hotel, it is clearly massive in size with three towers which contain in excess of 2000 rooms. This means the hotel is very busy and may not be to everyone’s liking. The hotel has plenty of restaurants if you want to eat there but at busy times be prepared to queue for breakfast. Our favourite breakfast location Spago on…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Fantastic stay and Team,"Stayed for 2 nights last weekend.  Arrived at about 430pm on a Saturday to check in, slight Q at the check in counter which was reasonable for a 2500 room hotel.  Had waited for about 10-15 minutes til it was our turn, while in line I was pleasantly surprised the staff was handing out fruit punch and little ice cream cones, i guess it was their way of saying thank you for your patience :) My wife joined me shortly after in the Q and missed out on the ice cream cone as the attendant had passed me already.  Mr David Cheng who was i guess, a lobby ambassador had seen this and proactively went to his colleague an taken a couple cones and gave it to my wife and other guests who had missed out on it.

They upgraded me when they found out that it was my birthday :) Our key card only worked on the fourth time upon check-in but they were patient.   The hotel has adapted to ensure a safe environment.  Towels are now wrapped in plastic and no longer hanging around . The remote control is wrapped in plastic too , there is no room service menu lying around that you can thumb through .   We decided to go Spagos  on a whim and they got us a table .  Do pre-book your favourite restaurant at MBS and your slot at the pool! We almost didn’t get ours.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Amazing resort,We stayed here for 2 nights when visiting Singapore and I am glad we did. This place is amazing and so luxurious and is a resort in itself. There is a casino that we didn’t go in.  A high end shopping mall with its own canal and top restaurants.  The gym is well equipped and located on the 55th floor with amazing views over the bay and Singapore. There is also a bar open to the public on the 55th floor but is $27 for a bottle of Stella. On the top floor there is the 150m long infinity pool which is lined with sun loungers and is great for taking a selfie with the city in the background. You cannot go to the pool unless you are staying at the hotel.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Amazing Experience and Value For Money,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 1 night. Staying on the 53rd floor with amazing views of the Gardens By The Bay. The room was huge and very lavish. The room was equipped with Hermes amenities which was a real treat   Dining at Rise restaurant was delightful. You would expect for a buffet to have food or average quality. However, this was not the case. The food tasted fresh and well prepared. Chefs were seen inspected the food frequently and service staff were enduring that the buffet line were in clean and tip top condition. Service was friendly and quick.   I would like to give a shout out to Suresh from the reception who made my stay in the Marina Bay Sands amazing!",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Memorable stay at iconic hotel,"We stayed for a one night staycation, and our visit was excellent.  MBS offered several good staycation promotions on their website.  Consider getting the Lifestyle Rewards card and get access to good deals, which are even better during COVID Phase 2.  The hotel was closely adhering to social distancing guidelines.  There were several ambassadors placed around the hotel to ensure it happened.  Three days prior to visit, I received a text inviting me to sign up for a one hour slot at the pool each day.  We chose to go at 5 pm the first day and 8 am the following morning.  It was fun to contrast the views during different times of day.  The view is amazing!  We arrived at about noon, and we were able to get our room before the official check-in time.  I think this saved us a lot…",Aug-20,,

I have celebrated my birthday in a city view high floor premier room. The moment I walked into the room I was amazed - the huge window captured beautiful skyline of Marina Bay. It’s so therapeutic regardless of the weather (it rained a couple of time).  The infinity pool was really a sight to behold. It’s really cold but so much fun. I actually like their crowd control measure whereby check in and facility booking are queued via SMS.  Room making was excellent. On the second day I placed a couple of champagne glasses and the service crew, Jian Yang placed the same number of coaster and espresso cubes for my guest as well. It’s a really nice touch which made my day!  I think it worth every single…",Dec-20,,

I was impressed to see the prompt room service despite the strict restrictions post Covid, everything comes in individual wrappers.The room and every touchable surfaces was sanitized frequently.

Huge, huge thank you to Mr. Dennis for making this possible for us. Special shoutout to Wawa, the staff attendant, and Nas, the life guard also for their help.   This was not our first time at MBS, but I'd say that this visit has became more memorable and amazing because of the service of these pool staff especially Mr. Dennis. Marina Bay Sands is truly lucky to have such a remarkable staff.   Even though we are visiting during this pandemic, we still felt safe as they explained to us how the hotel makes sure the cleanliness and sanitation for the safety of all guests are a priority. We are particular when it comes to service whether in restaurants, or hotels BUT…",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,For their famous pool and much more,"Rooms in this integrated resort are basic and very much like what you can get in a business hotel, so nothing to rave about unless you get one with a good view of the Gardens by the Bay.  The view from their SkyPark and famous infinity pool on Level 57 is on the other hand everything to go for as part of the perks as a guest.  Other than its perfect location to explore the sights in the area and direct connection to the train station, this is also the only place to stay where one can have easy access to the most number of award-winning restaurants on site. With the casino, museum, theatre, clubs and most shops which open till late, guests will not run out of things to do during their stay.",Jan-20,,

Booked a premium room with city view. The room size was huge,so was the bathroom with separate standing shower room and bathtub.  Family with younger kids or babies will love it because you have ample size to park your gigantic stroller and large space to open your luggages.  However, they do not have brushing kit or brushing mug for kids if you forgot to bring one. Bathrobes and slippers provided a upon request. (shouldn't that be included in the room since they know there are kids checking in?) Not to mentioned about having a stool for your kids to wash their hands or brush their teeth.

Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,1,Used to be one of the best hotels but sadly it is degenerating,Booked 3 rooms for a family staycation but sadly it was a forgettable experience.   1. Checking in took close to an hour for just one room. Subsequently was told that the other room keys will be left in the room that was ready. When my family members reached and was registering the two front office agents mentioned that there is no such thing as leaving the room keys in the room. Wrong info throughout   2. Tried to book slots for the infinity pool but system was full of bugs and eventually could not secure any slots. Was told by the front office agent that when I was trying to book on Oct 15 the system just went live and it was the first implementation thus there were a lot of bugs. Only managed to get a 9.30am slot in the end.   3. Staffs were poorly trained. Wanted to visit…,Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,Nice view from hotel room and pool,"We stayed in a premier room which was very spacious in both the sleeping and washing areas. The toilet cubicle, large shower cubicle and soaking tub were all separate. There were also two wash basins which was nice. We requested for a room with two beds and were therefore a little surprised that even though the room was large enough to accommodate two queen-sized beds, this was not the case. The room provided a very nice unobstructed view of the area outside because the window consisted of a huge glass panel. The popular infinity pool on the 57th storey was a good spot to relax with many deck chairs around and a dip in the pool allows one to snap pics with an unparalleled view of the city all around the hotel. A must for those who love posting selfies on your social media…",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,"Really nice hotel, great service, awkward to navigate",We stayed 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands resort for our first trip to Singapore. The hotel lived up to expectations in terms of excellent service in a stunning location.   If you intend to stay here it is well worth paying extra with your room to be able to access everything this hotel has to offer including the Club 55 lounge with evening drinks and nibbles where everything from top quality champagne to soft drinks is flowing for 2 hours each evening.   The pool is amazing with its city views. There are a number of roof top bars which again have amazing views at night.   As an F1 fan we could see a part of the F1 track which I took advantage of having a walk on as it is a street circuit.   Drinks are very pricy though so be prepared to spend a lot of you like a drink outside…,Feb-20,,

We're assisted by Mr Avan from guest services who is very friendly and helpful to show us around the property lobby. Got ourself a clean and spacious room facing the Seaview and Gardens By The Bay on the 34th level. The view is speechless here and there's a balcony to enjoy the breathtaking view. Two country view at 1 location when the weather is perfect and when its raining, it's like sleeping in clouds due to the altitude that we are staying.

The service was great even though the hotel was packed. There are staff around so that you can ask quick questions.   3. Its a shopping mall and casino by itself so you won't find short of entertainment. You can even go to gardens by the bay on foot  4. The housekeeping will make sure they santise every are of the room and towels were packed nicely to ensure you its clean.   5.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Spectacular hotel with best views of the Gardens by the Bay,"This hotel's reputation of course precedes itself, and so for my first time in Singapore decided to stay here for one night. The price per room per night is of course quite high (when compared to other accommodation you can find in Singapore) but there's a reason you pay - for the service, the views and the amenities. All absolutely superb! The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. We chose a room with views of the Gardens which we were very happy with as the views by day and by night are incredible. Guests of the hotel have access to the rooftop infinity pool (that you see in 1000s of pictures on Instagram).The views up there are spectacular, but, because it's so well known, expect TONS of people in the pool literally just sitting in there posing for the perfect IG shot.…",Sep-19,,

Upon our visit  we arrived early to drop our luggage off to be pleasantly told that our room was ready 3 hours ahead of our check in time which was a very welcoming surprise.   The room was very spacious and had plenty of storage, with an amazing bathroom topped with beautiful shower gels and shampoos  The view from the pool was absolutely outstanding which is only available to guests of the hotel  All staff were extremely kind and friendly.  Please be aware of how busy the ground floor reception area is as anyone including tourists can walk through the main reception   I would highly recommend staying here if visiting the beautiful country of Singapore",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Amazing,"We arrived to the hotel early morning (around 7:30am) after a very long flight. To our amazement they gave us a room straight away! The room was amazing, 2 twin beds and 1 roll in, as we were 3 people in the room. The view is amazing! The room was huge, with the most beautiful bathroom I saw in a hotel. The pool... people wrote that it's crowded with no place to sit, and noisy and whatever but we could find a place to sit at all hours we went up. The hot tub was mostly empty and has a very good view as well. If you plan on swimming, this pool is not for that. it's for being inside the water and just enjoying the views. More for relaxing than doing anything else. If I ever return to Singapore I will go back to this hotel... Oh and it has a huge mall connected to it that you can…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,An absolute must in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands may not be the most charming hotel in Singapore but, as everyone knows, it offers one of the most beautiful rooftop pools in the world and enjoys an excellent location. So, although I find such a huge and impersonal hotel quite far from my personal preference, I think that a first stay in Singapore should be at Marina Bay Sands. Just forget any personal attention, be aware you are just a room number and you will be happy there.  Our Grand Cityview suite was perfect in all respects: the greatest view over the city, large marble bathroom and all amenities you could wish for. Spotlessly clean and very well kept as well. As you can imagine the pool easily gets quite crowded but you can enjoy it anyway: I suggest you get there early morning by 11.00 am at the latest.…",Oct-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,3,High class hotel but poor service,"We stayed here for 1 night in November 2019 solely to experience the infinity pool. The pool is one to tick off the bucket list and the view is much better at night. We also went to the rooftop club/bar (c'est la vi) which again was another great experience (free entry as we were guests of the hotel). The most disappointing aspect for us was the poor customer service. It seems that the best of service is reserved for their VIP guests with the level of service for all other guests being well below our expectation or even what you could expect at other hotels on par. In the early hours of the morning we woke up to drilling in the room above us and there was no sense of urgency to resolve the matter, re-affirming the customer service experience or lack thereof. The infinity pool is…",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,On cloud 9,Back to MBS after 5 years. Location always very glam and crowded. Prices increased compared to the past. Deluxe room with city view for 2 nights in early Jan costed about 1400 euro without breakfast. Hotel was fully booked apparently.The place is worth its money just because of the infinity pool and the extraordinary bay view from its top.The bed is a bid too hard for me and at the 38 floor you could still hear the noise of the cars down the busy street. If you do not intend to go to the pool maybe you ‘d better consider your choice. The place is huge.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,4,Great piil,"The family booked two rooms at MBS for a staycation in view of the covid conditions, we cannot travel overseas during this period.  The check in was fast and efficient. We had some welcome juices during the check in. The safety measure put in place was appropriate in my opinion.  Rooms were huge and clean. The views of the garden view room was amazing. It has a balcony facing gardens by the bay and the marina barrage. The other room had a city view but no balcony.   During this period, the guest were only allowed one hour each day at the pool and we had to book through a system. But it was the best experience so far with us ordering food and drinks by the pool. The gym as appropriate with safe distancing measure in place. Like the pool, usage had to be booked prior.  Overall a…",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Impressive infinity pool but long lines at checkin,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands one night because I wanted to try the infinity swimming pool.  Also the spaceship appearance of the hotel is stunning.  The hotel checkin desk is part of a shopping mall and near a casino.  When we arrived, there were lines of people attempting to check in or check out.  Perhaps 200 people were in line.  We were grabbed by an assistant and taken to the VIP check-in reception area.  There were perhaps 8 people in line in the VIP area.  The people being served had some problem and one took at least 20 minutes and the other took at least 10 minutes.  Our room was what I call “nice holiday inn”.  The room itself was not impressive, clean, but nothing special.  The view however was fantastic.  We overlooked the Gardens by the Bay.  At night the light…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,A well oiled cog,"A well oiled cog, thats how l would describe MBS and its needs to be because of the sheer size.  From the moment you arrive your luggage is whisked away only to be renunited with you as you enter your room and no bell boy awaiting a tip! Reception is vast and more like Grand Central Station with the continuous buzz of people checking in or out  no matter what time of day and people just wandering in to awe at the place. I was allocated a premier room on the 8th floor my friends were on the 30th floor. I was lucky to have a room that overlooked the Gardens by the Bay and had a lovely balcony, and at night l could watch the wonderful changing light show over the metal trees.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Has to be the best in Singapore,"Yes, it is expensive but worth it. Fantastic room with views over Singapore. The roof top infinity pool is a must, we were lucky to be able to check in early so went up straight away, there was a shortage of sunbeds from 15.00 onwards. The towels are to die for, so big soft and warm and you are not restricted to 1 per person. Great adults only area of the pool strictly enforced by the lifeguards! All the staff are so helpful, courteous and pleasant, nothing is too much trouble. Only downsides, too many tourists who just come to look and get in the way. the hotel is mean in the bar, not even a few free nuts when you order cocktails.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,A great stay. Worth to do Club Room,"Just returned from a one night stay. Done the club room, really worth it as you get generous portions for Afternoon Tea & Evening Canapaes, also a hearty breakfast in the morning.  Pool is amazing and due to lack of crowds because of the virus we had it all to ourselves near enough.  Can pay deposit and room buy card/cash.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,1,Nice hotel but severely lacking in service,"I’ll begin by saying this is not a luxury hotel by any means. Overall the hotel is beautiful, the architecture inside and out is astounding and the surrounding area is immaculate. They rooms are OK, kinda dated and nothing special. The service level is very poor and had made for the worst hotel stays I have ever had. Especially for the steep rate.   Furthermore, if you are coming for the pool, forget it. The pool is far too overcrowded and quite filthy. Certainly not a pleasant experience even though the view is quite epic.   Elaborating on my service experience. Firstly, the amount of personnel on site is severely lacking. It is challenging to find anyone to assist you with even just a simple question. I traveled to Singapore while pregnant and unfortunately had a late 11pm…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,One of my absolute favorite hotels!,"The Marina Bay Sands really is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. We had the pleasure of staying in one of the Sands Suites at MBS and received the best service and had such a great experience at the hotel. The 24 hour butler service was so helpful and they never allowed us to want for anything. There was always someone at the hotel trying to make our stay even more special and I just can’t say enough good things about the Marina Bay Sands. I highly recommend staying there and giving yourself ample opportunity to explore the hotel grounds, because the options at MBS are really unparalleled.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,4,Compliments,"MBS has the best accommodation, amenities and the best service staff at the hotel, including of check-in staff/room service and other necessities.  The room is very spacious and children like and can play in the room without worrying of getting hurt.  I enjoyed the good scenery from the balcony.  The only thing a Chinese do not like is there is a big mirror facing the bed that we are sleeping and it is not a good sign.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Luxe and magnificent harbour suite,"We stayed in the Harbour Suite. It was huge and we had an uninterrupted view of the light shows at night. It is a little noisy though. For some reason it isn't as quite as expected.  The hotel itself was very busy. We had an exclusive lift which skipped the first 25 levels or so and free bottles of water which were very welcome considering the amount of people scattered in the lobby.  Despite being very busy, housekeeping did a very thorough job and went above and beyond. She (or he) folded my daughter's used pajamas and laid them on the huge bed. They made sure the room is neat, tidy and clean  I really appreciated coming back to a clean and tidy room. They worked very hard. Floor was squeaky and the cot was always made up.

It made me feel as a very special guest even im just an average Joe. Was very glad that my room was available from 7.30am when I came! Was also upgraded to a club room which was even better!  Pool was amazing and I also loved the jacuzzi to the stunning views! I was extremely happy with the fact that I didnt smell cigarette smoke at all by the pool area! In other roof top pools there was always this issue with people smoking and us non smokers always had to stand the obnoxious smoke. But this hotel had made sure that this was never an issue!

Such excitement was crush within a day when the hotel confirmation give a call that this room could not be occupied by 3 adults + 1 Child as we requested. I could only accommodate either 3 adults or 2 adults+2 children.

We didn't book a time slot but had tickets valid for the whole day as we were visiting Singapore from a cruise ship and weren't sure what time we would be able to get there. When we arrived it wasn't busy so we were able to go up straight away. We hadn't realised the Skydeck was quite a small area at one end of the top of the building, but still enjoyed our visit nonetheless. We had the most wonderful views over Singapore and the surrounding areas. There is a small cafe on the Skydeck so we had a coffee each which were quite reasonably priced. Where the top is curved we could just see the famous infinity pool area which is only open to hotel guests. There is a small souvenir shop on the ground floor.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,WONDERFUL STAY OVERALL,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We got a suite on one of the top floors and the view was spectacular. Included with the suit was the access to Club 55, so we enjoyed the perks that came with it: breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. We noticed a long line to get into the regular breakfast restaurant so being able to eat at the club was nice. The room was spacious and clean and the maid did a wonderful job at replenishing properly the towels and cosmetics. They accommodated our request for an extra twin bed but the service on that was quite slow. The pool offered a fabulous panorama of the city and I'd recommend going there during the day and at night.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,The Pearl Of Singapore,My wife and I stayed here to try as its location and facilities enface value seemed to offer a great opportunity. We were staying at Sentosa however after two nights there with persistent and reoccurring issues we had to leave. Upon arrival here we were warmly greeted and check in was a breeze. We had access to club 55 so check in was via the lounge on the bottom floor which is hard to see but to the right of check in. Club 55 was beautifully presented with helpful staff however very few clientele dress anything better than very casual. Ce La Vie has beautiful views and if you book in advance you can have a absolute view of the city for sunset. However expect that the patrons who paid $15 for one drink and a view will lean over the top of you or even sit eat your lounge without…,Jan-20,,

Now internationally famous world wide from the Crazy Rich Asians movie this hotel lives up to every bit of the hype that it has. Very impressive and state of the art with some of the most one of a kind features and views of Singapore.   Definitely hands down the best pool in the world on top of the hotel and only for hotel guests. Food here is the best!

Was worried about checking in but the process was fast with not many in the Sands Lounge. Recommend to pay a little more for Club Lounge benefits as the general queues were so long!

Our butler service was great - we had fruits, cookies , milk , cakes delivered daily !

The room that we stayed is Orchid Suite and we would recommend 10/10 to those who want to spend time with their loved ones privately. The view from our room is amazing (can be seen from the image).

There is a 10pm rule for visitors that is stated on the signage but the security team allow random people to bring guest upstairs (stating to take something from the room) and denied ours, then rudely told us to get registered at Tower 1 reception. We walked over and did the thing that we were told and only to be denied registration since it is past 10pm. It is messy and awkward for our 2 guests with the way things are handled. From the guest perspective, the security team are writing number of guest per room on a piece of paper that could be easily misinterpreted, look unpolished for a 5 star hotel.…",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jun-20,5,"Excellent Stay, Worth the Upgrade","When staying at a hotel with such a reputation, its very easy to approach with a cynical perspective. However, if our stay at Marina Bay Sands showed anything, it's that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.  Upon our initial arrival in a taxi, our bags were taken off us by a member of staff, ready to be brought to our room once we had checked in. Queuing at check-in took roughly 15 minutes and even though we arrived ~3 hours before it would normally open, we were told we could head up to our Deluxe King Harbour View room. This also meant that we could access the Infinity Pool straightaway, in that blissful quieter period in between the majority of guests checking out and checking in.

At night when the lights are on, we got yet another stellar view.  The staycation was topped off with a great dining experience at Cut by Wolfgang Puck at the Shoppes.

It took over 40 minutes to get checked in, it took less time to exit the plane, go through security and get our bags at the airport, our key card does not work in any of the barriers other than our room and the lift and we have been ignored in one of the hotel bars for 10 minutes whilst the staff stood around, took me three attempts to get a drink by the pool with around a 25 minute wait.

On sunday night, we waited for the light and water show at 9pm but sadly there wasn't any.  Another downside about this place is the lack of halal restaurants. Even the cake that was given for our anniversary wasn't halal too, abit disappointed. There is only 1 halal place which is Beanstro, previously Coffee Bean and Tea leaf (google didn't update) located at Shoppes. So we had no choice but to walk quite a distance outside of Shoppes to get our food which was abit inconvenient.

Free entry to infinity pool and observation deck at level 57. Although we didnt book the pool for swimming, we were able to gain entry using the room cards to take photos of the surrounding place. Minibar is complimentary and it comes with a nespresso machine.  I paid more than usual for this stay just for the view.

They could have easily put one of those big temperature monitoring cameras on the entrance and checked everyone making it less personal and intruding. You get the feeling that you are being so monitored and policed. It can be done in a less offending way.

When I was checking in, the staff told me that there were two options either on Lvl 33 (Tower 2) or Lvl 41 (Tower 3) and both had the same views. Since they were the same view, I obviously chose the higher floor room. No doubt the view from the bedroom of the city was spectacular, esp at night. However, I was disappointed that bathroom had the frosted glass where the view to the gardens would be. If I had not been misled by the staff, I would have went with the Tower 2 option instead.

They were also charmed by the city view every morning when they woke up and the night skyline during bedtime. Besides these, we also had complimentary tickets to head up to the observatory and it was a magnificent view up there! Foodwise, there were a lot of options and the kids were able to eat for free at the buffet restaurants in MBS as they were under 5.

Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,3,A nice pool. Nothing more.,"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you must visit if you come to Singapore, like a checkbox in a to-do list. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though. First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way. The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in. Because of COVID-19, you can only use the pool for one hour a day, provided you have managed to reserve a time slot, which is not always possible.  We…",Oct-20,,

We did a sunrise yoga - highly recommend it, the trainer (didn’t catch his name) was really cool too.  One thing that was quite sad - was the service. When we arrived we informed the hotel we are celebrating and the lady at check in said we will get a surprise in the room. We got nothing, mentioned it when checking out and the lady wasn’t apologetic at all, she said she will inform people and nothing was offered.

We loved the breakfast buffet at Rise & cocktails in the evening in the lounge. The pool area was busy as you'd expect at Christmas but young children are kept to one end of the pool which works well for everyone else! The pool food & drink service was fantastic.

Not only that, the room booking was meant to be overlooking the garden view, but during checked in my wife wanted city view.

You have a bed area with a TV and also a sitting area with separate TV.  The room was cleaned immaculately every day and we were left different towel animals each day, they are the cutest.

The hotel room, perfect!. But why the minus star-the coffee in the room was instant! Why? For the rate I expected brewed coffee or Nespresso. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and the ones that had instant were the quick airport ones or 2 or 3 stars. My husband who ""never"" complains, well did, for the first time.

We were fortunate in getting an upgrade on arrival and stayed in room 5015 which has the most amazing views of the garden and marina. We also had breakfast included which was delicious. Due to the time of visit mid Covid19 I must say the hotel had it spot on and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly giving the circumstances. Hats of to you all you are all amazing!,Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,1,One of the worst staycation I ever had!,"One of the worst staycation I ever had for the following reasons. Just to name a few: 1) The room interior is very average. Not a 5-star standard. 2) Rules & regulation are TOO RIGID. Will elaborate at point 3, 4 & 5. 3) We must bring our room cards when we use the facilities eg gym / swimming pool. We booked the pool for an hour (due to covid, limit to 1 hr which is fine), we were 10min late and didn’t know we need to bring 2 room cards for 2 pax. We only brought 1. The staff at the swimming pool insisted that we go back to to the room to take one more card. 10more min lost as we need to go back to the room + the slow lift made it worst.  4) I understand and will truly abide to the rule that we are unable to bring guests in after 10pm. But what I cannot understand is, my…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Majestic Luxury,"Marina Bay Sands is an engineering marvel and I spent a good amount of time just admiring its exterior beauty. We stayed in a family room for the first 3 nights (1 double bed and 2 single beds). The room is enormous, with more than adequate space for 4 adults, including your own balcony and 2 bathrooms (only 1 shower though). Unfortunately these rooms are on the lower levels of the hotel, so you do not get much of a view. However, for our final night we booked 2 deluxe rooms facing the harbour and these views were spectacular. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars to choose from, connected access to the mall across the street and a bridge to the famous Gardens by the Bay (take a trip at night for the full experience). The staff are friendly and helpful. The main…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Excellent stay at MBS,"I stayed at MBS with 11-14 December with my family and it was a very comfortable stay with excellent service. It was disappointing that we did not manage to book a pool slot when we arrived, but one of the restaurant staff at Spago, Dave, secured us two pool slots when we merely mentioned we didn’t get one, without even being asked! I was very touched and impressed with his act of service. It was a lovely family staycation- will return!",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Helpful valet staff with special compliments to Manivannan,"Am impressed with the attentiveness of the valet staff. Was waiting for my pick up to arrive ( was late by 20 mins) while carrying a sleeping baby and a few heavy bags. Manivannan noticed that and immediately came to check on me and if he can assist. I have rejected initially however on seeing me struggling after my baby switch positon, he immediately came over to assist with the bags and requested for a stroller for me to sit my sleeping baby. Am extremely grateful for his help and he is no doubt a gem in the service line. Am posting this review here as i couldnt find a right contact link to share my compliments on the webpage. Hope this review gets to the management. Thank you for ending my day well with the warm gesture!",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Incredible hotel!,"Wouldn’t hesitate to come back again and again! My suite was absolutely stunning, gorgeous views from the room of the Gardens by the Bay, and a beautiful view of the city from the infinity pool side and the harbour from the jacuzzi side. I will recommend this hotel to anyone, hands down. 10/10 in all areas. No complaints from my end.",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,1,I do not recommend at all,"I don’t recommend to go to this hotel in covid-19 . Usage of pool limited to 1h per day, slot most of the time fully booked. Breakfast was not included despite the high price. The service was not good at all also, not at all 5 star hotel standard.",Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Worth it!,"Yes it's on the pricey side for my budget and you're paying for the pool/view but in the end.....it was worth it!!  Check in was crowded but a staff member pointed out we could go to the 2nd check in desk, which had a much shorter line.  Nita greeted us like we were her favorite client all day!  After a very sweaty morning, the infinity pool felt soo good.  The area was pretty full but it wasn't the madhouse I was expecting, we found seats right away.  the drink service was fairly timely considering the volume.  If you stay on floors 34 or lower, you will have to transfer elevators at the 34th floor.   Room was very nice but not over the top, very nice bathroom!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Apr-20,5,Bucket list ticked,"Marina Bay Sands is in our bucket list and we happily ticked it off last December 2019! We enjoyed our stay although we have to get two rooms since we are five in the family! From Changi Airport, wete fetched by the MBS private limousine. We were lucky we didnt queue - we, were checked in in a jiffy! Thanks to the ever efficient Front Office Premium Services. We were billeted at the 44th floor overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the view was definitely spectacular especially at night! We got two interconnected rooms and we enjoyed the amenities that they provided us. Of course, we never missed swimming at theur iconic infinity pool at the 57th floor although the water was icy cold late in the afternoon and at night! As a whole our stay at MBS was once in a lifetime experience…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Best Experience!!! Made our trip to Singapore!!!,"It was my wife and my first time visiting Southeast Asia and our first stop was Marina Bay Sands. Obviously we heard about the hype via television shows and social media, but what we were not expecting was the excellent service and treatment we received. From the very start, Shawn Chin initiates assistance with coordinating our pickup from the airport. We were greeted at the hotel by Allie Seo who got us our room early with all the information about the hotel. She really made us feel at home. We were so touched I asked if they had availability on our return trip back to Singapore, and she coordinated and worked to secure us a room and get us booked up. We were originally supposed to stay somewhere else but we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to be with MBS again. The facilities…",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Iconic,"Marina Bay Sands dominates the skyline in Singapore and has quickly become one of tourists must see locations. If you can afford to stay here, you get to visit the Sky Deck for free and of course use that iconic swimming pool. If you can only dream of staying here, you can wander through the shops and eateries at ground level before purchasing your tickets to visit the Skydeck and appreciate the views over Gardens by the Bay and other Singapore landmarks. Plenty of photo opportunities!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jul-20,5,Best place to stay in Singapore,"This hotel is an experience, not the most welcomed check in/out but this is because the entrance is throughout the shopping mall. Once you are in your room you will be amazed by the comfort and beautiful views. The infinity pool at the top is the main attraction (the pool is only available to hotel guest) and is just amazing, you can also find a couple of nice restaurants plus a cocktail bar (this available to non hotel guest).  The hotel is within walking distance to the gardens by the bay (our room was facing the gardens) and the view at night is out of this world.  Highly recommend this place!",Jul-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Marina Bay Sands - A Flavour to our Honeymoon Trip,I have chosen to stay in Marina Bay sands for my Honeymoon Trip. The Hotel is really a iconic place to stay once in the lifetime. The infinity pool experience is something which can just be felt. All the staff members are very courteous. The font desk guy Jacky at the reception offered us complimentary room upgrade and decoration. Ryan lifeguard at the pool also gave his precious time to us and clicked our pictures. Everything in the hotel was excellent. Thank you MBS.,Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Observation deck,After a trip on Clark Quay and a wander through the very expensive shopping mall we reached the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  The common areas of the hotel are very crowded and whilst impressive in stature it didnt have a very special feel about it.  The lift to the observation deck was efficient and the views amazing across the city including the F1 circuit.  Definitely worth a visit.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Apr-20,5,Awesome Hotel and Complex,"Where do I start, the moment I arrived I was greeted, my luggage taken, escorted to the counter and check in and in my room in like 15 minutes.   The room, 50th floor city view king suite was gorgeous.  After quickly getting settled I headed to the 57th floor infinity pool overlooking the city, the pool is huge, beautiful, and the staff are there for your every want.   The hotel also has a shopping mall attached that is huge, has all the great shops and even more restaurants by chefs like Gordon Ramsey, Dan Boloud, Wolfgang Puck etc.  There are 2 rooftop restaurants, Ce La Vi and Loma, both excellent and Ce La Vi bar becomes a night club after 8PM with a live DJ.  I could go on and on,  I WILL definitely be back.",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Chaotically crowded,"When you are paying top dollar, you expect something extra special. You don’t expect a crowded foyer with tourists taking photos, you don’t expect to wait over 20 minutes just to get to the front of the queue to check in.  Rooms were large (slightly dated). I know this this is is an iconic hotel, but I get the feeling they are just relying on this too much.  They could really take this place to the next level if they wanted to, but I just feel right now, they don’t need to, as there is just so much interest in the place regardless.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,6* service!,"World Class Service! Highly recommended for anyone who believes top service is imperative to an enjoyable stay. Some parts of the hotel may not be spanking new (eg balcony tiles), but we were beyond satisfied by the excellence in customer service during our stay - certainly reason enough to want to come back again! Whenever we called with any concern (bathroom, pool slot and belongings left behind), this was not only addressed professionally, but empathetically and most swiftly.   I must say, for a massive hotel, Marina Bay Sands Singapore really has surprised us with the impeccable standard of guest relations. They clearly have guest satisfaction at top priority and therefore understood inside out, leaving even the most discerning guest impressed and assured to have an…",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Wow,"This hotel is amazing. The views, the staff, the food and cocktails were all amazing. We opted for an upgraded room with a marina view which I would recommend. The room was spacious and very well equipped to a high standard. Room service was equally as good as main dining and the roof top bar is a brilliant experience especially at night.  Would definitely recommend and this won’t be our last visit. Just fabulous!",Dec-19,,

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Great views!,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 30th anniversary trip and seeing the hotel as we approached from the airport, was exciting - it is spectacular and very imposing. The staff are efficient and pleasant but you are aware that it is a big hotel and they are busy. Not surprisingly, the best thing about this hotel are the views. We stayed in a Premier Sky View room overlooking the bay and I never tired of the view. The view from the pool is also spectacular but it can be a little busy up there. We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant up by the pool each day. One of our favourite things in Singapore was the night time light show in Super Tree Grove which is very close to the hotel and worth seeing. A great place for a first stay in Singapore but if we return, we will go for a…",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Amazing hotel but maybe needs a little more luxury for price,The pool is worth staying the night as you can only use the pool when staying in the room.  We we were lucky to be upgraded to a room with a  better view which was good as I think the wow factor would of been lost on the lower floors. There is an element of  nit picking to this as it is a 5* hotel which I think is mainly based on its pool an view. The room are a very good size and bath room is really good.  For the rooms to be better they would need coffee machines in the room not instant and a kettle. Just a few luxuries missing for the price tag. But still had a very pleasant stay. Breakfast was average,Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Everything you expected,"Stayed here three nights on a stopover and didn't regret spending so much money on a room here. There are many other lovely hotels to choose from so won't stay again, just because of the price, I was a solo traveller so the room charge did not offer value. You are paying for the service, the surroundings, the pool, the experience. I really enjoyed myself and had a lovely room on 9th floor, very comfortable and could not fault anything at all. The hotel is really a resort and it can be overwhelming when you arrive, three receptions, so many lifts and not all go to the floor you want. So allow a bit of time and patience to find your way around this complex. Shops, casino, bars, restaurants, spa it has everything so you don't need to venture out. I had a wonderful stay.",Jul-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,An over the top experience,"We stayed in this hotel during the F1 race. It lives up to billing. The hotel is a huge complex, but that doesn't mean that the service and accommodations are not uniformly good. They are. Sure, the pool would get crowded (we went for in the mornings). But everything was top notch - from the views of Gardens by the Bay, the size of the rooms, room service, the food, check-in and access to public transportation. I would stay here again.",Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Loved every minute,We stayed for two nights as a family of three and absolutely loved every minute!  We made a detour from Bali to Thailand just to stay at this hotel and we are so glad we made the effort!  Upon checkin our room was upgraded and checkout was extended without-even asking.In conversation we explained to the gentleman checking us in we were traveling for 4 months  with our 3 year old daughter. He was kind enough to write down a list of must visit places places in the Philippines while we are there.  Our room was huge and everything was of a standard you would expect.

Bed is still as hard as 7 years ago since I last stayed, no topper at all. It is not comfortable and room furnishings are old, creaked a lot in the middle of the night. Bare minimum in terms of furniture.  COVID observation in lifts are not strictly facilitated despite indicating 4 pax at max, disinfectant dispenser within the lift was empty at one point. Tapping into the lobby took some time due to the card scan, and the card scan requires you to leave your card on the device and pick it up afterward, so much for covid precautions with entry and exit, correct me if I’m wrong, that could be a daily pre-covid standard. Not a single welcome greeting was heard, felt like I was…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Fantastic Stay,Booked the Premier Room with Harbour View and we were located on the 41st floor. Room is nicely design with mirrors all around the room. Bathrobes were available for use. Room had a mini balcony overlooking the Garden by the Bay. Able to view the Serene Garden with no obstruction. Bathtub is available in the toilet too. Visited the Club 55 and in house guest had a 15% discount off the bill. Infinity pool is not to be missed. Recommended to go early in the morning to catch the sunrise and swim with a view as it is less crowded. Shout out to Guest Service Edwin for the great insights around the hotel!,Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Great place to watch the sunset & people watch,"Drinks at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on Grand Prix practice day.  $23 per person to get to the top & have access to the bar & seating area, the ticket includes a drink. Very buzzy place with lively party atmosphere. Super views over Singapore & great place to watch the sun set.  No access to infinity pool or restaurant unless you are staying in the hotel.",Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,2,Disappointed and Upset,I have to say I expected much more given the price paid. I've stayed at much nicer hotels for much less cost. There was always a wait at the lobby and for the elevator which was uncomfortably crowded. There was limited pool access while we were there and I didn't find the rooms to be above and beyond what one would expect for a decent hotel. I understand the hotel is busy and popular and some of this may be out of the hotels hands but what really made my stay disappointing was the way we were treated by management. We felt unwelcome and I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. It feels poorly managed and they are relying on their prestige rather than continuing to improve. The front end staff was welcoming and friendly though.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,3,Vast Hotel,"Fascinating hotel with pool on roof. Amenities in hotel and surroundings are excellent. Rooms large and breakfast expansive. However because of its size it lacks the ability to provide a personal touch. It welcomes, at a cost, the general public, which limits the guests options a little. Trying too hard to be everything to everybody. Pool on the roof is more a posing pool with 80% of those in the 1.2m deep pool having a mobile phone in hand taking selfies and getting in the way of swimmers limited though they are. Totally insufficient sun beds or chairs to accommodate all wishing to use the facility. Convenient location for Mall, Botanical gardens, and access to down town including Raffals. But overstretched. Overall expensive and not great value.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Out of This World,"5 minutes walk from Merlion Park and Gardens By the Bay, This magnificent beauty-spot has the most amazing view to offer, and the hospitality provided is Top-Notch.   Pool on the Sky Deck Park offers day and night view to die for.   The Light Show on display at night is quite  mesmerizing. Show Timings are as follows:  Sun – Thu: 8pm & 9pm Fri & Sat: 8pm, 9pm & 10pm)  The adjoining Mall is perfect  to laze around all day.  The coffee shop Origin + Bloom within the Hotel is out of this world. Gelato , Coffee, Salads, Wraps and Sandwiches are quite healthy and tasty.   In short, although expensive it was worth spending every penny.",Oct-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,A Trip To Marina Bay Sands...,"My trip to Marina Bay Sands was absolutely beautiful!!! I very much enjoyed the balcony and how it looks onto the glorious country that is Singapore. It was a genuinely great experience. The service was slightly underwhelming though. I find that in Spago (the one restaurant that is available for public booking) is slightly less cared for than that of the other restaurants. The rooms seem to be lovely and clean, and yes that absolutely beautiful that you see everytime you enter your room. Even though we are in a time of Covid the staff count was at a regular rate. The food is lovely and there are so many restaurants to chose from. Once you have eventually visited all of the facility you can explore the Marina mall which has many shops. A nice thing to do is take a trip to the…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,1,"Train, not MTR but staffs","Famed for hospitality, Singapore was our best ever expectation. But staffs here at MBS ruined our stay. The welcome is friendly, but what would be necessary to reach the quality of service requested from a hotel and the prices charged (costly anyway) :  WELL TRAINED STAFFS A.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Big rooms with fantastic views,"Did a short staycation with my family due to travel plans all disrupted by Covid-19. This is the hotel all the tourist will see on TV due to the iconic infinity pool.   The rooms we had was really big and spacious. It had a great view overlooking gardens by the bay and my young son really enjoys the view.   The mall itself has alot of high end goods but to us is not the best place to shop. Also, there are not alot of local fares within walking distance of the hotel, so if you want to have a more 'Singaporean' experience, this is not the hotel for you.   The only gripe i have is that check out time is strictly 11am. If they can make it to 12pm, i think it will enhance the overall experience and give us more time to enjoy the facilities better",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,May-20,5,Always exceptional,"Second time staying at this hotel. It is the luxury of Singapore and it does not disappoint. Rooms and bathrooms are a big size.

Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,1,Terrible night on anniversary,Clearly low on staff on reopening and not bothered about the “locals” on a staycation  Loud bang noise in the room all night.  Had to call And they sent security up rather than anyone interested. Therefore no follow up. Had a sleepless night. Not the best for our anniversary. Left in the morning without breakfast or going to the pool.  Hôtel réponse was half the room price back which clearly isn’t satisfying. We don’t go spend  over $1100 a night to get some petty cash back. We go for a special occasion and expect to be treated as any other guests at a five star hotel.,Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Excellent service,"Went twice within a span of two weeks, and was impressed by the service both times. Dad had to make use of the wheelchair and the wonderful roving staff stationed near the Tower 3 check in counter went out of his way to help us get to the top floor for our viewing experience, even though he had to make numerous trips up and down and around to make that happen. We were thus able to get in just before everyone else did. I didn’t get his name but thank you to the staff on duty that day (16 Nov).",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Amazing!!,"We stayed here for only one night, upgraded form a deluxe room to an Orchid suite, from the check in until check our, staff were amazing.

We will be back again!",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,1,"Budget offering, 5 star pricing","This is NOT where you want to stay. The hotel is full of tourists that probably have never stepped outside of their village before this.  It's crowded, hot (the air conditioning is always off).  The food here is so expensive and below average.  The buffet breakfast at Rise has good selection, but it's chaotic mess.  Servers are always running around and act like they can't hear you. The stations are always empty and you need to wait 10 minutes for items to be replenished. Worst part is the access to Gardens by the Bay.  One little elevator to cater to hundreds of guests.  The elevator has no A/C so it's like stepping into an oven with 10 other sweaty strangers.  10 years ago this place might have been cool, but it's clearly an aging relic that you will want to avoid at all cost.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jul-20,5,"Comfortable, spacious, amazing view","We were lucky to have a free staycation here. The room on level 42 has an amazing view of the garden n sea. The balcony is narrow so there is no room to sit, the room was very spacious, beds were huge and comfortable, baby cot was provided. Bathroom has a big bathtub, seperate shower and toilet and is very clean.   The pool do not allow kids with floats, only life jackets. It wasn’t mentioned on their website. Our 16 month old baby can only enter the pool with a life jacket or without it. The lifeguard said the float might tip over the edge.",Mar-20,,

The Infinity Pool wasn't available throughout our 2 nights' stay, but there were many other things to do and eat within the compound and outside it.  We stayed at Tower 3 this time, and there was a balcony where you could sit and eat, read or just chill and appreciate the view of the sea and Gardens by the Bay.  The bed and linen were extremely comfortable, and their service was very prompt and pleasant.  There are also many restaurants and shops to wander through. Great staycation.",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Amazing staff! Better than the infinity pool!,"Great hotel in every way, great room / amazing pool, everything you’ve heard is true.  However I want to specifically give highest praise to the staff at the infinity pool.  I lost my phone and suspected it was maybe stuck in one of the towels I had thrown into the bin, or stuck under one of the pool chairs.  Andy the lifeguard helped lift the pool chairs to look under them. The staff - specifically Zadk, Didi, Norshaeera, Firdaus - emptied two whole bins of dirty towels with me and just when I was about to lose hope they found my phone!

We also went to all 3 restaurants at the top, Spago for yummy lunch, Lavo Italian for dinner  and CeLavie with the sweeping view of the Gardens by the bay which was perfect ambience to celebrate our Anniversary.

Had the opportunity to stay at the city view and the garden/ocean view. I love the sea so i would always prefer the latter.  Things to note during the Covid-19 phase. They do not mention this when ur booking the stay but they do inform u at the receptionist that in order to enter the infinity pool either to enjoy it or just walk around, you need to book a slot. Its an hr slot for each time ur book. And its limited. Due to they capped it at only 50-100pax at each slot. My advice is u book it when checking in. If u manage to get a slot, it will be fabulous.  The pool is basically empty due to everyone is spreaded apart. My kids had a good time since there…",Sep-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,And expensive not so nice journey to the top,"I truly was more impressed with Marina Bay Sands towers from ground level than I was from the top.

Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,4,Nice spacious bathroom with a good view of the bay,The room was nice. Only thing is air con temp controller seems to be not working.   The bath room was spacious and whole room was clean and tidy. Mattress was comfortable to sleep in with a good firm pillows that won’t sink in so easily.   The infinity pool need to get Q number and each session is only 1 hour. So it was slight disappointment.   We ordered in room dining and breakfast. The breakfast spread was delicious but slightly less on the portion.   It was a staycation and would say the money was worth it for.,Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Gorgeous,"The hotel and the mall attached to it, and of course the entire tree park area was amazing. The architecture inside the Sands, the infinity pool and food/drink service by the water, was great. It's one of my favorite parts of Singapore. There is easy access to the trees, where there are various admissions for museums, and we visited everything at both day and nighttime.

Took a cab to China Town was fun...the food venders look amazing we had already eaten so can't give you advise.  Now the spa and restuarants a alittle on the pricey side but I would absolutely go to this place again",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Great drinks,"We went there for drinks, all the way up to one of its bars. Great service, Singapore Slings, amazing views of the bay, we even saw the fountain show taking place at the bottom of the hotel. The Infinity Pool was just next to the bar. Will definitely go back, next time will stay at the hotel.",May-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,The best stay so far,"My stay at Marina Bay was so perfect. I wish I stayed longer here. The price per night is expensive but I think this is worth it, the property is immaculate and impressive. The skypark, the infinity pool, jacuzzi everything is unmissable!! I think if you can afford the pricing , one must stay here atleast for a night just to experience the Marina Bay Sands which is one of the most iconic properties in Singapore.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,KUDOS! to Marina Bay Sands Hotel Team.,I book a Premier room to surprise a special couple. Both of them really mean so much in my life. I made a special arriangement to the hotel team to transform the room to a magical one. The team really did it. Thank you so much for the team .Both couple name Peter Wildman and Lizie really love the unexpected room surprise. I would like to extend my gratitude and thank you to the Marina Bay sands team for helping to transform the room. Your team went well above and beyond my expectations.

Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,2,Not good now,"I dont recommend visiting marina bay sands at the moment. Safe distancing rules are makes use of facilities troublesome. And some rules are quite irrational. Like your wife can go in the jacuzzi on the sky floor, but you cannot join her because of safe distancing rules.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,1,Staycation,The Hotel gave me a very good impression from the Front Desk staff to the housekeeping job very well done. However waiting for a cab took me half an hour. I asked a Malay staff who stand outside I want a cab where should I wait? She used her finger pointed a taxi stand so I waited there. 25 mins gone not even one taxi came in and I approached her again should I call the taxi myself or should I still wait. Then the other guy stand together with her says- you want me to call for for you? I told him the service here was very bad tarnished the image of this hotel. I called the taxi by myself. I believed as such a good hotel when I asked at the beginning she should have offer.,Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Staycation at its best,"Fantastic staycation with my family, in a wonderful and very safe environment.  We knew already of the high standards of this iconic hotel, but we were really impressed by the safety measures in place due to the ongoing pandemic. Kudos to the extremely attentive staff and the management for making us feel so safe, while enjoying a great and so needed staycation!",Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,3 nights in paradise,"Amazing hotel and staff. We had a city view room with access to club facility.  I  cannot praise this enough and if you can, upgrade to this option. It provided afternoon tea and drinks including champagne and canapés at night - you won’t need dinner.  Service from all staff was superb.  Only one very slight negative was that there was no real dress code in the club lounge.  Would have liked to see a long trousers, no shorts type policy.  If you can book more than one day to get the full Marina Bay experience. Superb hotel",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,May-20,5,Consistent Service Level,"Impeccable service from the start to the end, been there a few times with friends & family. We're always satisfied with the experience. Not to mention, the infinity pool is definitely a great place to wind down & relax. Particularly prefer heading there at night where it's a little more quiet. A wide variety of restaurants/bar are available till late too for those who might crave a gourmet supper.",Jun-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,1,Iconic pool not available,Just checked in for a 4 night stay and tried to book a slot for the pool. Found out that it was apparently full for all days. That’s crazy esp given the pool is one of the key attractions! Hotel guests should be prompted ahead of time there’s this risk so they might consider other venues instead or ask for pre-booking of pool!,Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Very nice.,"Marina Bay Sands is just beautiful. Roof top Sky Deck was just amazing as advertised. Attached to a large mall as well as the Gardens, lots of things to see and do. The Casino was also wonderful. I just found the hotel to have too many people from all walks of life, who were not guests, wandering around all the facilities, causing it to be extremely crowded, large tour groups, children crying, just not what I was looking for from such a high end property.  Imagine if you went to Las Vegas and there was only one hotel on the strip, and everyone who visits the city stops in there to look around. That's what it felt like.  I left and went to the Four Seasons. Aaaah!",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Awesome service,"Great service from Anna and team, Brennan and Edison. Thank you for making our wedding day so special. They have provided us nice cakes for our guests, we were very surprised by the kind gesture.  The food was great as well! Crabs galore was good.",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jun-20,5,"When its Singapore, its must be Marina Bay Sands","I had the best checked in experience in my 30 years of travelling pre covid. Upon reservation I was informed to check in at Tower 3 reception. While in line, I was asked about my reservation by a staff and after seeing my confirmation voucher we were asked to follow the staff to their check in lounge located at Tower 1. Its a little walk but worth it. The lounge is an exclusive check in with all amenities from unlimited fresh juices, coffee and bottled water. There are biscuits, pastries and candies.Wifi and a lot of beautiful orchids.  Front desk staff were very cordial and helpful. We also receive stem of flowers from the staff. It was a VIP experience indeed.   If the checked  in was an experienced, what more with the accommodation and the most coveted high top (55F) infinity…",Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,Marina Bay Sands,I would like to thank the service staff who attended to us from the check in counter (i didn't get her name) She was really helpful and patient with us. Thanks to all the staff at club 55 and the Rise who assisted us in taking our order and serving them. They are all polite and accomodating. All of them thanked us when we are leaving which made us feel special. 10/10 is actually my birthday and the staff in Infinity pool (Dennis) helped me in booking a slot and i am really thankful for his help if not for him it would be really very disappointing. Kudos to all the staff at Marina bay sands and keep up the quality service! Just to add one feedback if possible to have a bidet in the toilet 😅  Thank you. ❤,Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,A dream come True,"One of my favorite hotels to stay in when in Singapore. The service is always great and it’s very convenient. Very clean, and great service. And what I like most is that the hotel is big but service is quick so you don’t get to feel that the hotel has a lot of people staying at a time.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Top of the world,"We arrived as the virus has been affecting tourism, got an up grade to a suite for not much more as the hotel is very quiet. Staff are professional, polite and here to help. They appreciate us being there especially as it is so quiet. Pool was amazing, food great, service top notch as you would expect in this hotel. It is an iconic place and well worth a stay if you can .. if too expensive then do the visit it is worth it for the photos..",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Lounge Renku,I want to compliment Drake especially as he patiently made 9 teas of concoction for me which is very impressive. I am very happy. I also want to compliment Margie for patiently explaining and serving me the high tea items.,Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Great Hotel. Worth the money,"We were reluctant to book here because of the price, but it is definitely worth it, even just for one night. The infinity sky pool is incredible and a must see. You can only access it if you stay at the hotel, so this was the tipping point for us. They allowed us to check in early, which was great, all staff very polite. The pool was surprisingly not too busy. We arrived mid morning and got two beds straight away. Plenty of towels to use too. It was windy, because it is so high up but a welcomed breeze. The view from the top is incredible and one you cannot find any where else.  The room was lovely, big bed, nice bathroom and nice toiletries. 4 bottles of water included in the room and a nice balcony too.   For the price, all of the above is to be expected, but not always the…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,"Wow, what @ spectacle!","Taking an Asian tour, we visited Singapore- which was the place I really wanted to visit. Spending some days there we went to the top of the building during the day, the views are incredible. Well with 53+ floors it was bound to be! The shape of the building - 3 towers topped by a ship shaped top is incredible. It’s the place to be to view the firework display, held each evening! There is also a restaurant & swimming pool to facilitate the hotel rooms within the structure. We met up with friends who happened to be over there at the same time & had a great time in the nightclub, and had a ringside seat to watch the light show, drink some wine & dance too! It’s a must visit!",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,OVER RATED,"We stayed for Chinese new year. Light show is great and we watched the fireworks from the infinity pool. Room was average. Tea or coffee was only enough for one cup each.No milk just creamer and hardly enough. The robes were a ladies size 14 at best. No good for men at all.For $1000 for one night was an over rated rip off. We were given a double room when we had paid for 3 people. They had to bring in a roll away bed. Which reduced the floor space,A non smoking hotel but the people below us were smoking on the balcony, Plenty of other places to stay at that are much nicer, Save your money",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Family staycation when we cannot travel overseas.,"My family had a 3 days staycation at MBS. I need not say more about how beautiful the infinity pool and the skyline of Singapore is. The staff was friendly but firm as they take no chance in battling covid.   The housekeeping staff was helpful and ensure that our rooms are properly clean up everyday.  Overall, the stay was wonderful to recharge us and foster stronger family ties.",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,4,Staycation,"Recently had my staycation at MBS and it was a rather pleasant experience. However, the waiting time for check in was rather frustrating. I probably spent half of my day waiting.  However, the rest of my stay was rather pleasant. Especially the staffs at the infinity pool, they were really helpful and friendly. Rooms were on the high floor and had a birds eye view of gardens by the bay.",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,Nice pool,"We stayed 2 nights in MBS. Checked in was fast  as only 3 people in front of me ( I checked in on Saturday around 5.30pm ). Staffs are friendly.  Room is in good size with balcony overlooking to garden by the bay, Singapore flier and marina barrage. Bed is comfy and room temperature is easy to adjust.   We went to the sky deck but didn’t swim in the infinity pool. It’s very relaxing there. Lots of foreigners there and not many Singaporean guests there. We felt that we re not in Singapore.   Overall, It’s nice experience. We will  stay here again if there is promotion ;)  Today (23Feb Sun) I went MBS hotel lobby to meet friends and the queue at 3.20pm was super long. Maybe 30-40 ppl. It may take more than 45 mins to check in. Unbelievable..... just be prepared.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Great stay,"We had a really great time staying at MBS, the service, staff and atmosphere are awesome. We were on a staycation but it really felt like we’d got away! So much to do: shopping, eating, Swimming etc... there are lots of promotions at the restaurants and bars so we spent lot of our time eating and drinking!",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,MBS - one of the best,"We had a night stay over in MBS and it was a lovely stay. Staff was polite and helpful. The hotel has rooftop bar, restaurant and infinity swimming pool so worth visiting and staying over.   It's very close to Gardens by the bay and you can see the night light show from the roof top. We were allowed late checkout.   Hotel is expensive but it's worth a visit!   If you are vegetarian, they have quite a few items in their restaurant menu..  Mind well..if you are off to the airport from the hotel...most of the taxi companies have a fixed price",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Stunning views and good service,The room was spotless and benefited from a good sized balcony. Very friendly staff. Our deal included breakfast which gives a choice of three restaurants. Rise gives you the better breakfast but Spago has the views but also a queue. We stayed in a garden view room. Great views of the gardens by the bay. There is a very busy road in front of the hotel so sitting out on the balcony was noisy so if you want a garden view room go for a high floor. The hotel is attached to a luxurious shopping centre with expensive food options but there is a food court.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,Enjoyed my stay !,Checked in when i was drunk and the receptionist was super friendly and nice. Even the in-room dining was friendly to two drunkards at 2am asking for food . The service was over the top . Worth the money and will comeback for sure .,Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,Magnificent view from the infinity pool,"Huge and very busy hotel but rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Magnet for tourists so you don't go anywhere fast on the ground floor! The gym is OK and despite being comparatively small for such a large hotel, never seems to be crowded. The infinity pool is spectacular and whilst I'm not a huge fan of all the beds being next to each other in a long line you can forgive that with magnificent views, all pretty cool. Food delivered to your bed is very good too, as are the cocktails and fairly reasonably priced given the situation!!",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Excellent service and pristine clean rooms,"Booked a room to celebrate my friend's birthday. I wrote in early to request for their help in planning for a surprise party and was amazed by their promptness in replying and in doing their best to accommodate to all my requests. I was impressed that the concierge staff even knows who I was and what I needed when I simply told him my name. He explained that all concierge staff had been briefed and they were supposed to remember such details.   Needless to say, the room was pristine clean, the best I have stayed in Singapore, and the view from the room was just breathtaking.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,On the top,"Nice place. Interesting experience look to the city from the swimming pool on the roof :) Good variety of restaurants, underground station nearby. You can watch from your room a laser show in the bay or light show in the Garden, depending side of your room. Or watch both from the roof :) Of course, overnighting is not cheap, but worth to try once:)",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,amazing view!  Pool! breakfast! shopping center! 57th floor!,"Marina bay sands hotel  is one of the symbols of Singapore!  One of the best view to marina bay and harbor front!  You can choose a room with a gardens by the bay  or marina bay view! In my opinion, gardens is better! unless you are coming for the F1! or new year!  I prefer to get a room at the low floor! since i do believe that they get smaller to the top!  Rooms are nice! And of course, everything is nearby!  Of course, most of the people are coming there for the pool! Im one of them! Duo to my photography needs, I  have to come there time to time!   I like the pool during the good weather(for pics) or cloudy weather -  much much cooler outside!   breakfast is nice as well. Front desk is very helpful and friendly! But of course, I do believe that If you are nice to people then…",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,2,A little disappointed..i expected more,"Went on a weekend staycation. For a 5 star Hotel in Asia the hotel was pretty average.  Little things like room keys not working and check-in desks not open were annoying and not what I expected.  The iconic infinity pool had the best views in Singapore but its not designed for inclement weather. No sun umbrellas or rain covering so if it does rain,  EVERYTHING gets wet.  Worth staying only to cross off the bucket list. I won't be coming again.",Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,Fantastic,"Stay was fantastic with helpful front desk staff, great service at the Origin Bloom. Staff has great patience for customers with many requests. Room service was prompt and all of them are smiley and helpful. Special shout out to Ryan at the infinity pool who showed us great photo spots and helped us take some photos.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Marina Bay Sands 5*,"I cannot put into words how special this place is. We spent our last 3 days here after a month long trip travelling around Australia. It was the perfect end to such an amazing trip. We planned this stay as part of our anniversary and I cannot thank the team at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel enough. Particularly Allie and Joanne you made our Anniversary so special. We was surprised with airport transfers, wine, cake, cocktails by the amazing pool and a beautiful box of hand crafted chocolates as well as an upgrade on our room. You really went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. We will definitely be back. Thank you once again. Danny & Donna",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Bucket List Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights (24-26 December 2019), came for the pool and view!  Along with everyone else.  Hotel is clean, well catered for and rooms are functional.    Dropped a star based on the experience of the other guests and the constant selfie instagramming!    Pool didn’t disappoint but water temp is a lot cooler than was expected.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,4,3 night stay in deluxe room with balcony,"Was staying in mbs after phase 2 implemented. visited skypark swimming pool at night and in morning to take sunset and sunrise photo. Pool was by appointment but worth the effort as it was no longer crowded. Room comes with balcony, with nice view of garden by the bay, though the balcony needs some cleaning, could be due to covid19.  Restaurants just below my room and mrt within walking distance.",Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Stunningly amazing hotel!,"I stayed at Marina bay Sands from 26 Dec, 2019 to 30. When arriving, I felt literally a stunning feeling I’ve never experienced at the entrance floor. The first impression was like, how large! how tall! and how glittery! My room was “Premier Twin Garden View” type on 26th floor. Some sort of plant just outside the window disturbed the view though, we enjoyed the beautiful sea horizon of Singapore. Amenities are nice and luxury of the room was ok. maybe the same as Hilton. Rooftop pool was amazing but I did not swim. Just enjoyed the atmosphere. The room services were splendid. You might want to bring your own plug converter for your hair drier otherwise it may be broken b/c of high voltage. Don’t miss the botanical garden. As to the nightlife, I spent such wonderful nights…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,First MBS experience,"There is a queue during check in but staff are fast to respond. The room is comfortable. Infinity pool is perfect. Lucky I got the news we need to do booking and  went ahead to book the pool 1h for each day before I check out. Pool wasn't crowded. They are very strict w the number of visitors, so don't think of smuggling more visitors in. There is like security checks at every tower and there isn't any way we can cross Tower. 🤭 Enjoyed the stay.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jul-20,5,It was like a dream with family. Excallant pool and room. Perfect view.,Marina Bay Sands should be experinced once in a life. The pool was excallant. The room was clean and big. You feel like a king. The roof view was excallant. I storngly suggest to stay at Marina Bay sands who visit S’pore,Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Sands Skypark Observation deck provides panoramic view of Singapore,A panoramic view of Singapore can be seen from Sands Skypark Observation deck all 56 level. The view at night especially sound and light show in Marina Bay is amazing from that level. Even lights of Thai coastline are visible. Place a must visit at night while visiting Singapore.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Luxury,Welll Singapore is an expensive place and ofc here is expensive too. This is orginally a hotel but there is a mall downstairs. This mall is for only luxury shops. For picture you have to walk other side of the bay. There is nothing to see under the building. There is a skybar in the hotel but I am not sure if they are open for only guests or people from outside.,Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Heaven on Earth,"My daughter was desperate to stay at this hotel during our stopover on the way back home from Brisbane as she'd seen it get built on a previous visit.   There's a danger with a hotel of this scale (it is huge) for it to be soulless and impersonal, but we didn't find that to be the case.  From the minute we stepped out of the taxi, the service was faultless (although pool service quite slow), but most importantly friendly and personal.   We were on the 18th floor with a garden view and what a view!   But of course, the main attraction is the rooftop infinity pool and it didn't disappoint.   Make sure you stick around for sunset and beyond - it's truly wonderful.  Getting sunbeds together was a bit tricky first thing as it's so busy, but it seems to be quite a transient clientele,…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,1,Staycation,Please do not book here during this time.  Only 1 hour at the pool allowed per day and you don’t even get to choose the time.  V disappointing 😞. Understand that there are Health and safety procedures on place but other hotels are offering better deals.,Aug-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,The view is just breath taking,"If am going back to Singapore for holidays then definitely its Mariana Bay Sands. The shopping mall close there has everything you need from consumable goods to electronic goods and many more. I saw many great mens outfits. I had no time for exploring further but my first impression, its a great place to be.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,4,Hard to beat MBS staycation during pandemic,"Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids had a thoroughly enjoyable staycation at Marina Bays Sands. Our room on Level 29 had a good city view. Looking out from our window,Apple stand was on the left and the Artmuseum was on the right. The whole complex was very crowded. Who says we are living in covid 19 restrictions?Car parking was a bit of a hazzle. So was the q for hotel check in.The restaurants were busy most meal times. Access to the infinity pool was difficult as guests were limited to one hour session per day.The Skypark observation deck on Level 57 is a must go at MBS. All in all,too much to do and to enjoy in the 2night 3 day stay.",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,A must when staying in Singapure,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands in November 2018 and it was a great experience. Had the luck of having a high floor room facing the Gardens by the bay which has balcony and sunrise views. We were still jet lagged so we watched the sunset at the roof top jacuzzi and it’s like stoping in time on how beautiful it is. Infinity pool is of course amazing. The only downsize that I would say is the fact that the hotel is so big that we never interact with staff, asking if the stay is going well etc and had to queue for check in, however the receptionists compensate by personalising the checkin more than usual so it’s a good balance. Would definitely return",Apr-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Impressive hotel but impersonal service,"Stayed here at the start of our honeymoon. On checking in the receptionist asked were we on holiday and we told her honeymoon. She congratulated us & when we got to the room we had a ""happy anniversary"" cake. We didnt receive anything else to mark our honeymoon so it didnt feel that special.   The room was spacious and comfortable. We stayed 2 nights and only received turn down on the first night. I found it odd that for such a large room and bathroom it was shower only - no bath. Which would have been nice to relax in after a long day walking round Singapore.  We used the pool and had no issues, busy but not crowded & just amazing views on both sides. It was the main reason we booked here for our honeymoon.  If returning to Singapore I would not stay here again. It is good for…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,An experience in itself,I stayed at this iconic hotel in June 2019 with my husband and 3.5 years old daughter. The experience right from check-in to check-out has been just amazing. Needless  to say that the mall attached to the hotel is huge and has almost all luxury brands. the iconic infinity pool is just superb and one cannot explain in words the experience that it gives. The staff here was super helpful and did everything that we requested for in a very minimum time. Overall this place gave us a superb experience off Singapore.,Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Superb😍,"Have just spent 2 glorious days at this hotel. We could not praise this hotel enough, it’s magnificent. Everything about it is wonderful. The views from our 32nd floor room were out of this world. The room was very comfortable, spacious and spotlessly clean. Brilliant facilities, the rooftop swimming pool, sundeck and roof garden were a joy to experience, Food and dining were delicious and the staff were absolutely brilliant, they couldn’t do enough to help and please. A definite hope and wish to stay here when we next visit Singapore!",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Unforgettable Stay,"It’s a great place to unwind and relax. Room was big and the view from our room was nice. Infinity pool view was breathtaking. Staff were kind, polite and cheerful especially Dennis and Evangela. They give us warm service while we enjoy the view of the city on the pool side.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Obviously this is a badge of Singapore,"At the time it was opened I was a student in a poor country and was only able to dream about... Now, traveled around the world it was still a POI we simply could not miss, stopping by in Singapore. IMHO at this moment Gardens is the best attraction and it is free)) But hotel itself gives the atmosphere you need to pay for. Recommend unless it’s your monthly income - in this case just enjoy surrounding",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Stunning view,"The observatory deck is on the top of Marina Bay sands hotel. The view from above is stunning, we were lucky with the weather too. Worth to go up and drink a Singapore Sling on the top 🙂 for sure recommended",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,Nice hotel but a bit crazy!,"MBS is a lovely but very busy hotel.  It is not exactly a place for a peaceful, relaxing stay but we had stunning views from our room (we even had a small balcony which I wasn't expecting) and we absolutely loved spending time in the infinity pool.  Whilst the pool was always quite busy it wasn't as hectic as I expected it to be and we always managed to find sunbeds and had enough space to enjoy the pool and the views from it.  There is a fantastic selection of restaurants.  We had a lovely dinner at Adrift and really enjoyed our breakfast at Rise.  Overall, a nice place to spend a couple of nights even if it is just to try out the infinity pool!",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Excellent experience,"The rooms are very well maintained, spacious and came with a huge balcony facing the Gardens, sea view. The bathroom and facilities were excellent. The best part was the Infinity pool up on the 57 Floor. You're swimming in the air. And you get to see Singapore from a bird's eye perspective.",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,Exceeding our expectations,"We were offered an upgrade to a better room. We had our own grand piano, gym, spa room, sauna room, game/karaoke room and own kitchen. The balcony overlooking the bay was simply spectacular and it was a one of a kind experience.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Great Stay for the experience,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a tour of Asia for a Honeymoon last Christmas.     We stayed in Tower 3, city facing.   Our room was huge as is everything at Marina Bay.  The hotel is geared up to keep you onsite, there is so many places to eat and play, I could have done a week there.     The roof top pool truly is amazing, yes is busy but its Marina Bay what do you expect!   We love cruising and we would class's this as a cruise ship style hotel.   If you are after an intermate & personal experience the Marina Bay probably isn't for you.   We will defiantly head back to Singapore and would stay at marina bay again.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Great place to finish off our trip,"Spent the last two nigths of our trip here and glad we did! Wonderful Garden Club room with access to the Lounge, excellent service and staff. LOTS of people though, especially in the infinty pool. We went up in the early morning though to avoid crowds. Food was great and room was fantastic and comfortable. Bathroom was huge!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,girls trip,"Infinity pool - the most stunning place ever! Incredible view form the room and roof! I can't even explain. Nothing more to say! I've enjoyed with friend birthday trip in Marina , and customer service offered us better room and small birthday cake . Thank you!",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Apr-20,4,Rooftop Pool Swim!,Spent five nights in Singapore to acclimatize to jetlag and flight arrival and departure times. Couldn’t justify 5 nights here due to the price but did opt for two nights. We were in a family room which was well appointed and quite spacious. Early check in without a problem. Got a room fridge delivered to store our alcohol and beverages as too pricey from the minibar. Great location. Ate at the Marvel restaurant for the black bunned Batman burger. Not bad.   The rooftop pool was worth the price of the rooms. Spent many hours lounging in the sun and soaking in the pool and hot tubs.,Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,Good service and clean rooms,"Nice view from hotel room balcony, friendly  and helpful service crew. Due to virus, there is lesser crowd and every lift lobby was placed a hand sanitiser. Love the indoor hot pool with sauna and steam room 😊",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Fantastic Hotel!,"Wasn’t sure if we were doing the right thing staying here but so glad we did! Had the best time, room was wonderful and the view amazing. The roof top pool was something else, open until 11pm and busy all the time. But lots of fun, everyone just wanted to get photos whatever time of the day. Breakfast buffet was so good, everything that you good possibly think of was there and so fresh and delicious! Great location right by the Gardens, Shopping Mall and River Ferry (lovely trips)",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Ticked all the boxes!,"Worth staying just to use the infinity pool!!! Staff informative, helpful and so friendly, hotel impersonal as it’s so large, pool cold but the views also take your breath away, roof top bar (on salsa night) very lively.  Downside- wait for elevators particularly at check out time...took 25 mins to get down from floor 22 in tower 3 at 10.30 am!!!",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,3,Good stay at Marina Bay sands !,Had a staycation with family ! The rooms were comfortable. Enjoyed the infinity pool though we had to book tine slots in advance and they tend to get sold out pretty soon. Was happy to receive observatory tickets as a part of the staycation deal and the kids enjoyed the view ! Overall a nice experience,Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Definitely place to stay in Singapore.,"The hotel is always very busy, people everywhere and you have to wait in a line for swimming pool and breakfast. But it's a must stay anyway! Amazing view from the swimming pool and actually I believe from all the rooms without paying extra. Amazing breakfast, top quality food! Yum yum yum. I can return just for that. Feel of luxury is present, high quality customer service and friendly staff, very tidy and clean.",Nov-19,,

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Dreamland,"This is a must see place on the globe to experience, see and taste. Vibrant, complex, textured, stimulating, and stunning Singapore will not disappoint your enthusiasm for flow of excitement and intrigue. Besides being innovative, densely populated, internationally diverse, Singapore continues to establish new standards for urban planning, land reclamation, water desalination, and financial processing.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,4,A Little City,"This hotel should be experienced at least once, the sheer volume of people is staggering! A huge busy busy complex, lots of energy and movement. The iconic pool is not to be missed - fun to swim around at the top of the world! The hotel staff was very attentive, we had a snafu that they more than compensated for. Plenty of places to eat with a great variety of cuisines. Not for someone wanting a relaxing experience - but great if you want around the clock entertainment. The water show is amazing as well.",Jul-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Iconic and living up to it.,"Obviously the most iconic hotel of Singapore. So we had to stay here :-)  The first impression when you come in, for us, was that it's huge! The lobby is immense, large and high. The reception is a bit 'American' with lines waiting to check in, but they are quite efficient. And very commercial, so they sold us an upgrade, which we really loved in the end.  The room was great. Spacious and super view of the Bay and Singapore skyline.  The famous pool is lovely to be at. It's not really a pool, in the sense that it's only about 80cm deep, so forget about swimming, but it serves very well to cool down and make super pictures. There is a great choice of restaurants in the hotel and if that's not enough, it's connected to the Mall where there are dozens more.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Next Level Glam,"Everything about this trip was amazing. I had heard the check in process was difficult, but that was not at all our experience. We arrived early, and our room was ready. They quickly brought up our bags. Our room’s views (Sky level room) of the city and the bay were magnificent. The building seemed to go on forever with shopping, a casino, dozens of restaurants, and the Bayfront metro stop all accessible without ever going outside! But nothing compares to the pool! Those 680 ft views absolutely take your breath away. We stayed nine nights in all, and it was a dream. We have not stopped dreaming about our trip since and plan to go back ASAP.",Jun-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,1,"Outdated Rooms, not a five star",Outdated rooms and old. Towels and bathrobe provided were rough and hard. Uncomfortable bed and pillows. Huge rooms but depressing. Nothing luxury and poor service. Don’t waste your money here. Stay somewhere else.,Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,TOP of the world and Singapore!,Iconic!  Popular despite it’s $300 -800 room rate.  Good service.   Incredible infinity pool for unforgettable photos!  Outstanding celebrity restaurants like dbBistro and Cut.  Wish the rooms were more modern and Japanese “full service” bathrooms installed. Wish TV system was more user friendly.,Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Superb hotel,"Stayed 5 nights in a room on the 32nd floor facing Gardens by the Bay. Hotel was superb, room spacious and well equipped, bed huge and so comfortable. There are several restaurants on site something to suit everyone’s taste. The facilities were excellent and the infinity pool on the rooftop amazing. All staff were helpful, friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. Highly recommended.",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Christmas break,"Very big hotel with a huge swimming and spa area on the roof top. Busy place at all hours similar to a small shopping mall. Gardens are well lit up at night,  Free lazor show is good. Three restaurants for food and breakfast, only one is international. Choice is limited for Halal food. Room service is good Location of the hotel is good with easy access to Singapore underground.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,ONE OF A KIND,"Stayed at the MBS for 3 nights in late February.  Our stay was exceptional, undoubtedly enhanced by a upgrade to Premier Room due to a wedding anniversary.  The hotel is immaculate.  Our room was spacious, with fantastic views from the 44th floor.Dined at LAVO where the food and service were excellent. The infinity pool provides impressive views of the city.  This is Singapore so be prepared to dish out a few dollars more for everything.  MBS, a rewarding and unique experience in a one of a kind building.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,4,Bday celebration.... 07.10.2020,"Nice hotel room with a wonderful view for the hotel room. Stayed at level 42. Really enjoyed the relaxing stay at one night with a large bath tub and bathroom area.. cleanliness is excellent.  Having a dinner at the Celavi restaurant, food is average, lack of manpower but still okay. At 11pm, we went to infinity pool to enjoy the Swimming pool - Super amazed with the view..",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Marina Bay,"I just want to express my sincere thanks to the person who returned my daughter’s iPhone that lost in Marina Bay on 15/01/2020. We lost and found it just within hour, when we reported to information centre.  Now we’re back to Sydney Thanks one more time to all people, so many good, kind, giving people, doing the right thing.  Vincent",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Wonderful Staycation,"Staycation was great with beautiful harbour view. Room was clean, Staffs were friendly. Good promo given with 60 credits per room/night which it can use for dining. Sad that didn't manage to access the infinity pool as it was fully book! Will definitely come back for staycation again.",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Simply breathtaking!,Special mention to Nikki at check in desk. She was a superstar and made us feel very special. Thank you!!! Views are absolutely amazing. Time on 57th floor pool and viewing area at any time is stunning.  Our room was very spacious! Had everything you could want.  Clean. Loved it.  For us it was a once in a lifetime experience we will never forget.,Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,1,Old dirty room for Staycation,"Super crowded at lobby, just feel like at first world hotel in Genting. Room is old and full of dust. Cleaning standard really need to improve, see photo then you’ll know what I mean. 5 star hotel but the most only 3 star for me. Don’t waste your money.",Dec-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,3,February Stay,"I stayed here early February for work, due to my work i had to travel and stay at hotels, this hotel has good product. My opinion, lacks human touch, i didn't feel the passion to help, and in fact i would say robotic.  This hotel will be top class hotel if they master the human portion of the business. Also, do focus on maintenance and housekeeping.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,Heavenly,"Possibly the best stay we have had anywhere. Everything was perfect. The upgrade was very welcome, as was the surprise birthday cake when my birthday was noticed. A special little touch. The rooms were spacious and well set out. The view over Gardens by the Bay and out to sea was great. The COVID and safety precautions are well thought out and executed. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was a great place to hang out. Sadly at this time only one hour sessions are permitted and it’s best to book well ahead to secure the time slot you want. A wonderful place to stay. It felt like a real holiday away from home.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Not to be missed Singaporean experience in an amazing landmark building,"We stayed in a nearby hotel, but visited the foyer and the bar on the top to experience the atmosphere. Building itself is so eye-catching and fabulous to look at...especially if you've seen the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"". We booked a table at the top bar adjacent to the restaurant. If you come just before dusk, you'll be able to enjoy the earlier light show in Gardens by the Bay when the Super-trees light up. You can enjoy drinks and nice bar food whilst lapping up the spectacular sights. Not to be missed on a visit to Singapore!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Has to be done!,"Has to be done if for nothing more than the obligatory photo from the roof top pool. Get a garden view room - which also looks over the harbour - best views EVER! Get a room above the 22nd floor or you have to change lifts to get to the roof top. Don’t include breakfast, get that from the pool cafe on the roof top. We loved our family stay. We loved Singapore!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,Fascinating hotel,"Have been staying in this hotel for multiple time and still look forward to visit whenever time permits.. the service staff have always been attentive, accommodative and friendly throughout.. facilities are well maintain and cleanliness is always at high standard.. great view if you are staying at high floor.. convenient location and great place for shoppers at door steps",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,4,Modern metropolitan hotel,"This was an enjoyable stay even though it didn't feel like we got out of the city. Did the usual activities like the infinity pool, gym, and eating at MBS. Because of COVID, everything was well-organized if you'd just follow the rules. We felt each session (gym/pool) was too short and could be longer though. Would be great to have more packages where F&B or spa are included.",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,November Staycay,"Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era.   However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained.   All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Stay  here!,"Everyone needs to stay here at least once in their life! Get a high floor with a view, it is really worth it. The pool is really nice although it has a spring break vibe. Service was nice and friendly throughout the hotel. The hotel is huge and kind of feels like Las Vegas, actually there is a casino connected. There is also a great mall and it is wonderful to be able to walk around the gardens and see the light show from your room at night.  My room was nice, comfortable bed and nice bathroom.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,4,Short stay,We stayed just after the new year on our way back from Bali .. Although check in que was extremely long one of the staff guided me to vip check-in which was quick .. the lady was informative also ask our reason for our short stay .. since my son turned 21 & I turned 50 booking at this hotel was our gift from my hubby .. she had sent to room a cake for us too sweet she was also kind to extend our checkout as my flight was midnite with use of gym wish the pool was also excess able too ..   room was clean & huge with all amenities .. with the view of the gardens by the bay .. awesome .. porter that brought our bags up was very informative & friendly .. as the marina bay sands is known for it pool .. WOW ..only thing is not enough chairs .. totally crowded.. & service was slow .. we…,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Epitome of Luxury,"We were on 27th floor. We had selected Garden view. After that I would have preferred City view. The much awaited part for me was the infinity pool. The view from there was just amazing. It has a different vibe altogether.   The premises encompasses everything restaurants, roof top bars, mall, games & other activities. It is very well connected by road & metro. Major Tourist attractions are nearby.   Best way to commute in Singapore is via Metro. Very well connected",Feb-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jul-20,3,The lifeguard at the pool section was rude,"So, I was in my room and I felt like taking a swim at the infinity pool located at the top of the building in marina bay sands and managed to enter in with my pass and as I was walking past 2 lifeguards, one of them screamed  ""oiiiiiiiiii"" out of nowhere and I was shocked and confused. It was pure rude of them, and I was affected throughout my whole journey because of this punk, I do not know his name but I do know he's a muslim. Please keep your staff disciplined before allowing them to come out to work in this industry, acting like hooligans, is simply downgrading your company reputation and image. I would not recommend anyone near the pool, or as a whole in marina bay sands! with those punks roaming around.",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Amazing place to stay,"We had a great time at Marina Bay Sands. It had everything within walking distance such as - shops, restaurants, casino, entertainment. We had a room with sights overlooking gardens that had a light show every night which was awesome. Highly recommended.",Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,3,Not worth the cost,We stayed here for two nights and felt it was overpriced.  The bed was hard and not comfortable. It was a nice room but not worth the money we paid. We ate at Spago and it was great. The pool was cold but worth going in. It was nice that they had an adult only section and their were plenty of lounge chairs available. I would recommend only one night so you can use the pool but won’t need to stay here again.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Apr-20,5,Short visit,We stayed there for 1 night only to attend an event so we didn't had much time to explore the whole hotel. Great location with superb facilities. You will be amazed how many guests this hotel can accommodate everyday. They have 2 front desk counters in each side of the wing. Accessible to their MTR also there's mall next to it with a lot of restaurant choices. We get to visit their casino as well. A must visit in Singapore so I suggest you should make it worth it. Hope to be back soon. #longoverduefeedback,May-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Great hotel,"Must have item to stay, not just to visit. It is large like factory but everything works perfectly and the rooms are nice. Main attraction of course the pool on the top floor, access only to hotel guests. Breakfast worked well also downstairs.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Wonderful Stay everyone so nice,We arrived shortly before they closed down Singapore We wish them all the best. We arrived early and were offered a great room on a high floor facing the city. The view was amazing. Close to gardens by the bay which was very empty making good time as no people were there,Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Awesome Staycation,"It’s a great place to relax, room was big and the view is fantastic (it’s a garden view). The pool is amazing and staff were so accommodating and kind. Upon entry we were greeted by Dennis and Catherine they were sincere and cheerful. Dennis assist us on where is the best spot to take photo and where to get the things we need to enjoy this amazing pool. We’ll surely recommend this hotel. Great place and service. ❤️",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,A great experience in a technologie miracle!!,"A luxurius hotel with big room and excellent breakfast in one of 3 or 4 places, by the pool or at the lobby. The pool is a miracle at the 57th floor with an amazing view but little bit cold in a cloudy day. Swimming in this pool is a unique experience!! The staff was very polite. There is gym and sauna free. Of course is an expensive place with a luxurius mall but it;s worth  place to visit in Singapore,",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,ANOTHER ITEM ON BUCKET LIST TICKED OFF,"One night/ two day stay purely so I could swim in the pool. Did not disappoint. Check in was prompt and efficient, upgraded to Orchid suite on 52nd floor. The room plus views over the gardens were spectacular. Complimentary access to club lounge on 55 floor where a good range of drinks and snacks were on offer. The pool has the wow factor as expected with great service on offer. Will definitely return. Nothing too much trouble",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Landmark but worth the money to stay?,Infinity Pool is overcrowded. It’s a great place for shopping and dining but the the room facility is not that good. I think mostly too many guests stay lack of well maintenance. Personally I won’t suggest stay here but worth to visit the place.,Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Worth the stay,"Stayed here for one night with my husband.  Excellent service and politeness of staff, could not get any better. Food was all delicious, breakfast included was amazing! Views from the roof top pool spectacular, got good sun beds while we were there right by the pool. Great it’s open early until late 6 am til 10 pm!  Rooms all spacious, comfortable and clean with lovely smelling toiletries. All in all it was an expensive nights stay but worth it for at least one night. Thacker you for a lovely stay.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Beautiful Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed 2 nights before going on a cruise.This hotel is very large and beautiful,with nice attention to detail. We had pre paid our stay and the only Complaint I would have is upon check in the clerk strongly urged a upgrade and when we said no he seemed a bit short. An extra 200$ per night,no thanks.The room was clean staff friendly. The roof top pool is like no other! It is expensive to stay here however we did enjoy our stay.",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Wow!,A must-to-stay hotel in Singapore which is mostly famous for its infinity pool. There are many chic restaurants you can dine in. Also the casino is huge! The hotel is connected to the best mall of Singapore.,Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Enjoy Singapore hospitality at its best here.,"Great place to go for a dinner at the restaurant Lavo on the 57th floor.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Amazing place to stay,"Everything about this location is decadent.  The rooms, views, rooftop, pool, spa, shopping and eataries.  The best part was the cafeteria in the sub level.  Everything was reasonably rpiced.  I had a garden view room and the views were specatular.  Definitely recommend staying here.  only downside is the infinity pool can get very crowded.  I recommend going VERY early like 5am/6am early if you want good pics.",Nov-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Staycation,Infinity pool and SPAGO staff is really awesome. In the pool...uncle coach/lifeguard very friendly and humble. RISE could be better. Renku is very good. Worlds best gym experience.  Daniel Boulads dB oysters was a treat,Jul-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Staycation at MBS,"Due to COVID shows are cancelled.   But we still have great family bonding time together.    The staff at MBS is efficient and helpful.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Great service,"I’ve checked in earlier yesterday and I’m Glad I was assist by Ms Hill from front office team. She’s very accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable about the hotel. Me and my friend had a great stay. The hotel is located in nearby tourist spots, very convenient as the mrt is near also. Perfect for first time travellers in Singapore.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jul-20,4,Staycation,"Room is clean and big. Nice view with balcony. Pool is definitely breathtaking with awesome views. Too sunny to swim in the day, took a swim and relax after 7pm, so windy and cool. Very nice of the hotel to give us a complimentary small slice of cake for our anniversary.",Jul-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Excellent staff,"I would like to compliment a staff named Hannah from the front office. She is very kind and helpful and shows great initiative in her job, keep it up! Enjoyed our stay there. We stayed there on 1st December 2020.",Dec-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,May-20,5,Staycation on 27/28 March 2020,"MBS is one of the top hotels in Singapore, and the most famous, for the iconic infinity pool view.

You can't expect anything less with a top hotel, but my oh my, they really outperformed themselves. Keep it up, team MBS!",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,A modern city with a lot of history,"A must see.  Such a phenomenal site seeing the hotel. Also the Merlion has been nicely placed here. There are plenty of places to eat or drink, and everyone will find something to there liking.  Great nightlife.  Singapore is a safe city to go late in the evening.",Sep-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,MBS Tower 3,"I stayed at MBS Tower 3 room 4416 with my family. Due to the Covid, the check in process was abit longer. Overall we are very happy with the services at MBS, the room was clean and facing the garden view. I would to say a big thank you to the housekeeper at level 44 Miss Wang Li for her sincere smile and service. We will definetely come back for another staycation.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Will go back!,"Just like everything else in Singapore, this hotel is very nice and worth staying in! We visited during the New Year and it was amazing experience!

Service at its best!",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,No words!,"Must visit to complete your Singapore itinerary even if it’s for a day. Gorgeous rooms, awesome view from balcony. Breathtaking view from the top floor....nothing can beat it. Infinity pool was a super hit for non swimmers like me too!! Hospitality is beyond words. Breakfast and dinner spread are splendid.  These guys could really teach hospitality to all!  Easily connected to all attractions.  Facility to store your luggage while you enjoy the day after you check out.  Expensive but worth every penny.",Oct-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Fantastic pool experience,"This hotel is all about the rooftop pool, but it is so worth it!  The rooms are nice and big. Choose a room facing the city and above 10th floor. We stayed in a premiere room which was huge and with a giant bathroom. The breakfast at the top floor was also fantastic. The hotel is huge and commercial but it doesn't matter to us.",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Luxury and Comfort rolled into one,"Your Singapore experience won’t be complete without a visit or stay in one of the country’s renowned beacon. My family and I welcomed year 2020 with a nice view from our room. As expected, our room is very clean and cozy.   The structure never fail to amaze me and no doubt, Marina Bay Sands is really an epitome of success and elegance!",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,2,Tourist Trap,My family of four arrived excited to stay in this amazing structure. Good service on check in clean rooms. Unfortunately that’s it! No spots at the pool due to selling tickets to get in & no paying guest priorities. Then went back later to the rooftop for drinks only to be told at least 20 min wait for a drink. People sleeping on pool deck chairs in the morning to get a spot!! Over rated tourist trap!,Apr-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Don't stay there,"Was so excited to stay at the hotel.  But the service and food are horrible. Took us more than 1 hour to check in, even though i did it prior to speed up the process lol.  ok, at the check in counter, they asked for the passport details even though at the online check in i already provided everything. So i guess their system is not interconnected between departments at all.  Service by the pool is horrible. Unfortunately, you can  feel racism. They would serve first Asians, then others. Even if you were first.  On a positive note, great views and clean rooms.",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,MBS,The last time i went to mbs was in 2019 December I went with my friends and family. i am a member of the hotel and I get special rooms for a good price. food was nice staff was amazing and the rooms were clean and nice,Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Incredible Hotel Stay,"I booked a 2 bedroom and was upgraded to one of their suites. It was so spacious, luxurious and had an incredible view of the Garden by the Bay!!! When we walked into the hotel lobby, there were so many people and the check in process was quite impersonal that I thought this is a ""one and done"" stay. Was I totally surprised by the room and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore. The pool was okay only because it was so crowded.",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Weekend of luxury,"Stayed here for a weekend and WOW, fabulous hotel, great food (very good value in the food court in the basement) . and views to die for - great service, lovely drinks and just standing staring out of our window was perfect (40th Floor). Infinity pool beautifully clean, stunning vistas over the city and the harbour.  Spacious rooms with floor to ceiling windows (not for the faint hearted)  Wonderful and memorable experience",Feb-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,5,Good service and friendly staff,"Staycation with auntie for 3 days 2 nights. Very happy with comfortable and clean room, nice garden view.   The room attendant - DAN DAN very friendly and polite. Room cleaned by her also very neat and clean.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Not impressed,Been there 2012 and it had wow factor! So easy to compare for me. Now nothing special except pool. Breakfast could be better quality. Can't​ do late check out and use pool. No more airport transfer. Not everything is clean and looks like it need renovation.,Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Luxury ..worth the money,"Visited beginning of December 2019. Luckily the weather was mostly dry.  Worth every penny for this stay. Beautiful views from our balcony especially at night facing the gardens and bay. Very lucky to see a Christmas light show in the lit trees. The pool is beautiful and the jacuzzi. Room was very nice,comfy and clean. People are so nice,friendly and helpful everywhere. So clean and nice everywhere inside the hotel. Gardens well worth the money to visit. Choice of so many places to eat inside and outside the hotel. Don't miss out on the Singapore sling 😉  None of it cheap but good value. So glad we did the one night stop over on way to Australia from the UK.  Great experience and solved the jet lag problem too .",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,"Super service, beautiful clean rooms, good restaurants - a must do!","The service is amazing; in particular , Eric at the VIP desk was very welcoming and made our first trip to Singapore special. An old friend and I were celebrating our 25 years of friendship and staying at MBS was a lovely way to do it. I highly recommend the hotel. Food was very good too!",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Average,"Everyone except the front desk guy was snobby AF, I think his name was Mansor, he was really nice and the only good thing. This isn’t a luxury hotel it’s a basic 4 star hotel with a pretty pool. Musky smell in hallways. The elevator is annoying and they could definitely have better signage to direct you. Everything’s got different closing times. Felt like my whole time was spent walking hallways looking for proper elevator. Concierge desk was very unhelpful. Nobody has any information. Had a terrible experience at lavo and everything is beyond overpriced.",Feb-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,3,Nice view,"Nice view, but otherwise nothing special. Better to go to some bar or restaurant down town. This place is a little offsite. You need a bus or cab ride to go there. Otherwise, Singapore is a nice but somewhat odd country to go to.",Jan-20,,

I am not pointing fingers at any party. But it is indeed painful.",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,Amazing hotel.,"We stayed at this hotel in February 2020. The hotel is amazing, the best breakfast I had so far (with different cuisines: international breakfast, Indian, Chinese and even more). The stuff is very friendly and helpful.

Staff were so friendly and amazing we even got an upgrade and a birthday cake left in our amazing suite. This hotel is stunning. Yes it’s very expensive so you get what you pay for.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Come sail away...,"This is such a cool iconic building and structure, almost as cool as the sail building or the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai. This literally looks like a boat on top of 3 buildings.   It’s a hotels and casino. Riding the Singapore flyer allows you some cool views of this intriguing building up close and more personal.   The interior is just as cool. This and the Gardens By The Bay are what come to mind when I think of Singapore.",Mar-20,,

You book a table at Spago and get seated at the bar with a Vogue magazine. After several phone calls. Butler service is ridiculous. The lounge is fantastic, great staff and food!  I am sorry.

Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Great experience but it felt too crowded,"Great hotel. The highlight is definitely the infinity pool. Rooms are amazing, with nice views. Service was extremely professional. However the lobby was way too crowded with people that were visiting the hotel. There should be a separate lobby reserved for hotel guests only. The queues are check in were really long. Apart from these two points, everything else was perfect.",Sep-19,,

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,Has Everything One Could Want,"I remember watching the construction of MBS from another property. It's an amazing property.  Great views, beautiful rooms, excellent club lounge, most extraordinary infinity pool anywhere and great restaurants.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,1 night stayca,"I would love to thank receptionist, Min (if I’m not wrong) from tower 3 on 20 March at 2ish.

We would never dream of experiencing such an amazing stay because of him !",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,2,Don't book if you have a late flight!,"Facilities are of course great - no doubt about that! 3 issues we experienced:  1) We were a bit put off by the check-in. In general, the hotel is super crowded and you will have to wait in line quite a while before you can check in (felt like being at the DMV instead of a 5 star hotel) - luckily, there is a quick check-out though. 2) Paying a room here doesn't really make you feel like a guest, but basically only entitles you to spend more money. E.g., you can pay for a VIP check-in, breakfast is of course not included, etc. So it did just not feel like you got what you paid for.  3) Most importantly for us, but of course a specific situation due to travel times:  What they don't tell you before booking is that you can only access the sky pool from check-in to check-out time,…",Jan-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Apr-20,1,No way would I stay here!,"We recently stayed in Singapore and decided to visit Marina Bay for a drink (and a nosy) we had wanted to book to stay here, although didn’t as thought it seemed pricey. Thank God we didn’t!! It is terrible. The reception area is huge, but full of people (not sure if they are hotel guests of people having a nosey) there are so many people it is like being in a busy shopping centre, nothing nice or relaxing about it at all. It does not look like a grand reception, just a very busy place. We looked in a few of the shops (mainly selling magnets etc) then just walked straight into the guest lift which took you to the guest rooms (not one person questioned this) we then reached the level where the bar was, which was great as we wanted a drink. The bar seems very run down and shabby,…",Mar-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Feb-20,5,The reason I traveled to Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an entertainment destination, and the reason why I traveled to Singapore!  I arrived in Singapore mid-afternoon and took a taxi from Changi Airport to Marina Bay Sands.  I entered the short queue to check-in, I was greeted with a bottle of water, and moments later with the friendly front desk staff.  The check-in process was quick and I was off to my room on the 31st floor facing the Garden by the Bay, which is exactly the view I wanted!    The room was spacious, clean and very inviting.  The bathroom was large, the shower was fantastic, comfy slippers were provided, and most importantly the bed was super comfortable.  Housekeeping had a good attention to detail, right down to the towel origami.    There is lots of things going on at Marina Bay Sands,…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Comprehensive New Years Eve Review,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights for New Years Eve 2020. The stay was expensive; $700 USD average per night for the cheapest room type. We stayed the other nights of the trip at the Grand Hyatt Singapore so that we wouldn't go broke on our trip. When we left the Hyatt to go check in at the MBS, we figured there would be no chance that our room would be ready. We checked in at 9:00 am and they not only got us a room right then, they also gave us one on a high floor (36) even though we had paid the cheapest rate which was for the bottom 10 floors.  The rooms are nice. Modern fittings and they come with little balconies. The beds are hard but the shower pressure is elite. There is no bad view since you will either see the bay and all the skyscrapers, or you will be on the…",Dec-19,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,4,Enjoyable Trip but do pre-book everything due to Covid,"Tips on how to maximize your Staycation:  1) Book your pool access immediately after making your hotel booking. The max allowed capacity at the pool is 45pax from each Hotel Tower at any point of time. Each Hotel room is only allowed an 1 hour visit to the pool per day (for our 3D2N staycation, pool access was full & almost fully booked for the entire week of our stay)  2) Pre-order Peking duck at Blossom restaurant 3 days in advance (they are having promo of $48++ for entire Peking duck)  3) Coordinate your family's hotel facilities usage schedule: pool, gym, sauna, skylark all requires 1 key card per pax for entry. The hotel room only operates when the hotel-issued card is slot in. Therefore if 2 pax are at the pool, those in the hotel room will not have any electricity /…",Oct-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,1,Absolutely garbage,"Talk about an icon, skyline defining, world renowned, you would imagine the customer service is decent, but the front desk actually insulted me and made a mockery out of me, I have never met such a rude bunch of hotel staff in my life, in particular a staff named YURI, working the night shift.",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,1,Not a five star hotel standard service,"Just wanted to try how is a popular 5-Star hotel in Singapore, but i was surprised that the service was so terrible with a unfriendly and spoiler staff.  In the first place I had been queued for more than 45mins to check-in the hotel. I understand currently situation of Covid-19 so we understand.  The most terrible thing is that when we had planned and prepared a surprise for our family member, the Tower 2 staff spoiled the plan. Due to is already pass 10pm,so no visitor are allowed to come up the room. But my sister ended the work at 11pm and travel all the way here. When I had already explained the situation to the staff and he did a damn sarcastic replied ""oh, is it. Hmm, I need to send 2 security guard to follow you guys go up and see the surprise already then send them to…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,3,Staycation,"I recently booked myself into a staycation at Marina Bay Sands, whilst I understand why people stay here, the view is incredible, including from the roof top pool - love the fact they limited the pool usage to prevent overcrowding, including at restaurants   My only concern is the hotel is looking quite tired (stains on carpets, couch torn, just general feel) for the price I was expecting a luxurious room, instead of something dated back 10+ years ago...being a hotel that prides itself on occupancy levels averaging 94-99% annually, thus would’ve been a perfect opportunity to improve its already dated product",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,1,Worst 5 Star Hotel,"Spoilt the mood throughout the stay of my family and I, on our son's 1ST birthday staycay at MBS Hotel. The worst part is, their Housekeeping threw away my bag of NEW clothes that was placed in the hotel room. We came back from our happy lunch only to foundout that my new clothes that we just bought yesterday was thrown away by MBS housekeeping without our permission. Touching our personal belongings and our items never came back! It is def Theft and breaking the security rule! Best part, they do not really gave a sh*t about it. My items wasn't returned til we checked out, til we are home. The service is VERY POOR. No effort at all. The check in/check out is EXTREMELY POOR & SUPER SLOW. Queue is not even moving.

Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,3,Staycation,"I moved to Singapore in February just before the lock down - not being able to travel has been a real downer so thought this might be a good change of scene from home for a couple of nights.  Was upgraded to an Orchid suite on 52nd floor on arrival which made up for the chaotic check in (felt more like an easy jet check in at Gatwick to be honest). Beautifully appointed room with lovely views but nothing outstanding.  Real downside for me  was the change to pool access - On booking I checked if there were an restrictions and was told not - once you were in, you could stay as long as you wished. Then it changed - one hour per room per day.  I tried to book at 1am in the morning and no morning slots for the day ??  Felt this was a poor show as nowhere else to really hang out…",Aug-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,3,Sorry that I have to rate 3/5,"MBS, supposingly one of the premium hotel and I was looking forward to it.  I have had high expectations on it since it prices are usually within >$600 but I got it at a discounted rate so it’s a good time to see what’s the hype all about.   It’s covid I know the hassle of getting the people safe distancing from each other.  I was with child, pram and luggage, sadly I found myself having difficulties with the door, it wasn’t an automated door, it was a pull/push heavy glass door, so erm I had to figure my way in. I Guess the hotel staffs are more busy being the safety ambassador, the valets parking attendants, the screening of temperature, so nobody to attend to the door.   Check in was smooth, request granted and everywhere we go we were greeted with so much love and warmth. So…",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Aug-20,5,Pool is truly the highlight!,"Stayed with a friend for 2 weekday nights in early August as a late celebration for her birthday (in June). Hotel accommodated our note and kindly gave a yummy chocolate cake despite it not being her actual birthday month.  CHECK-IN EXPERIENCE Was allowed an early check-in at around 1pm. Check-in, at least at Tower 3 where we were, could definitely be quicker and with more counters open. Thankfully we got to the counter right before a majorly long queue started forming behind us, but it still took us 20 minutes. Do take note that besides SafeEntry, there is a rather lengthy MBS form to fill up as well.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Worth the extra splurge!,"First and foremost, need to mention this...one of the hotel staff members saw 3 adults with a boatload of luggage and a slightly cranky toddler in a stroller about to get into a very long line to check in, and immediately asked us to follow him.  He led us to a room tucked in back of the main registration desk where we were assisted immediately with our room reservations.  This was a wonderful gesture assisting a family where at times it can be difficult to go through registration or stand in line with young fussy children.  My husband thanked him for recognizing our situation after we got our rooms.  Stayed in Tower 1.  Great layout, knockout views from the 42nd floor, comfortable and clean.

We stayed in one of the family suites in Tower 1, which although on a low floor was perfect, plenty of space, very clean and well kitted out.  Nicole Lee and her team made us feel incredibly welcomed, and went well out of her way to make this special visit even more special (it was a dual celebration of my son’s birthday and our anniversary).  Of course the main attraction was the infinity pool on the 57th floor, which was probably the highlight of our stay - and where our kids (11 and 6) insisted we spend most of our time.  We ate lunch at the pool 2 out of the 3 days - it was very good and surprisingly not over priced as compared to many other 5+ star hotels.

(And there was a nice feel to it)   This time we went to Singapore we chose Marina Bay Sands again as we had invited my parents (my father is architect and I wanted him to experience this fantastic construction ).   And the building and construction is still fantastic - must be on top 5 of the most iconic buildings in the world.   BUT apart from that - this hotel is (with 2560 rooms) one big “bed factory” - very unpersonal, extremely high noise level no matter where you are - reception hall, restaurants, pool area, garden - NOISE EVERYWHERE.

Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,3,Oops.. Not as good as i thought..,"Firstly, it may be a one time thing. We got the room with noisy fridge(i thought was aircon) which makes me (a light sleeper person) not able to sleep on the first night. After i gave them a feedback, they straightly change the fridge to the new one without noise. I was almost gave up my second night to just go back home as there is no point to do staycation without good sleep. Thankfully after they changed the fridge, everything was OK.  They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.  The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early.",Nov-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Oct-20,5,"Great view, especially the infinity pool","The hotel room is huge with a spacious toilet and bath tub. We got a view facing the sea and it is an amazing view during the day and at night. The view from the infinity pool is also lovely. Booked the time slot from 6pm to 7pm and even though it was cloudy on that day and not able to see the sunset, the view of the city is great. Definitely worth every dollar for a staycation in Singapore!",Sep-20,,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Club Access is King!,"Our family of four had a wonderful one night stay in the Grand Club King room (garden view).  We were in Tower 2 (same as Club 55) on the 29th floor.  We made the most of our day.  Scored an early check-in at 10:30am and was in the pool by 11:30am.  We had a snack at the pool followed by afternoon tea 2pm, canapés and happy hour at 6pm, and breakfast at Rise (excellent pastrami and lox) the following morning.  Club 55 is high up on the 55th floor with great views and service.  Highly recommended to get a room with club access.  It's actually a good value since you get three meals (including a nice happy hour) and you save time not hunting around for restaurants to eat in. Worth a splurge.  Reasonable surcharge for children club access (SGD $62++).    Tips:  If you want the pool…",Dec-19,,

For our wedding anniversary we opted to stay local for a couple of nights to support our local businesses. Many thanks MBS for supporting frontline Healthcare Workers. We were upgraded to a Premium King with Harbour Views, which were breathtaking. The room was cavernous with a balcony, which was great to watch sunrises/sunsets. The toilet was particularly large with separate shower cubical from standing bathtub in the centre, and distinct Toto waterclosets. The minibar was complimentary and foamy Nespresso coffee got us off to right-starts in the morning.

This was our first visit to Singapore.  Definitely happy we decided to stay at MBS. MBS just felt like you were truly experiencing Singapore. Loved the rooftop bar and infinity pool. Granted the pool was busy (do it early) but it was worth the pictures and memories. And couldn't get enough of the view from the bar at night. Granted  the hotel is busy but it is a destination of its own. Also have to commend the hotel for taking steps to be safe in light of the coronavirus pandemic. As you entered the lobby everyone was thermal scanned for a fever. Also lots of hand sanitizer sitting in common areas. Other hotels did the same. Our next stop on…,Feb-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Dec-20,5,Great experience at MBS,"Was my first staycation at MBS and decided to give it a try as traveling overseas is not an option at the moment. Decided to go for MBS because of the promotion they had and the free parking. Booked a 2D1N stay in premium room for 3 pax and it was a great overall experience. MBS has staggered check-in process by making advanced sms bookings, unfortunately I missed this information in the email they have sent and only know when I reached the check-in counter. But the check-in process was rather smooth once it reaches my turn. Got a room at the 30th floor, great view, great room. I managed to book a 1-hr pool session and it was a nice experience but rather short, sadly. There were activities to keep me occupied for the 2 days: touring of Art Science Museum, dining at Koma,…",Dec-20,,

Room was perfect with natural light and fantastic view.   Well maintained room accessories, high quality bathroom fittings and well-cleaned windows hinted that the hotel pays attention to details. Clean towels wrapped for higher safety during the pandemic.   Perfectly working air-conditioning control and WiFi was better than expected. Room service was excellent both in terms of food quality and classy delivery.   Infinity pool experience was excellent, almost magical as advertised.

Marina Bay Sands,Nov-20,4,"Staycation  - Deluxe & Suite - Good, could be better","Never really thought I'd do a staycation, but with Covid putting paid to all travel plans for the last so many months a weekend away at a hotel barely a few kilometres from home suddenly seemed to be not that bad of an idea.  The good -   The hotel does a really great job of prioritizing health and safety and it felt very safe.  The infinity pool - was not my first time, so the charm had admittedly worn off but was an instant hit with the rest of the folks in my group.  Hard to find fault with what's truly an eclectic experience  The views and the glitz - Enjoyed both the city and garden views, both were good in their own ways.

The in-room dining menu was superb. My guests and I enjoyed the burger and pizzas, we order them again.  The friendly chambermaid was so helpful to ensure all room ameneties were replenished as soon as I rang for her assistance.

Marina Bay Sands,Sep-20,5,Beyond Expectations,"Stayed 4D3N with my girlfriend's family. It was a complimentary stay with for an Orchid Suite and Premier Room. Honestly was not expecting much as I heard from others who stayed that it was an almost no frills casino hotel.   Check in at the VIP area was smooth and many safe distancing and sanitising measures in place to make us feel secure. Took roughly 15 mins to get to the counter on a Friday afternoon.   We requested for connecting rooms but due to my NRIC having a different address we were allowed only adjoining rooms which was a minor inconvenience. We had the luxury of having an amazing view from the 46th floor of the city for both rooms and the Orchid Suite bath tub facing Gardens by the Bay, a sight to behold.

We stayed 2 nights checking in on the public holiday Monday after National Day.  The deals are good at the moment but there are a few things to be aware of given social distancing that may impact your stay.  1. Check in - I was maybe naive to think it would be quieter on the Monday as people were back at work from the Tuesday.  However, the check-in took us over an hour of queuing at what was quite a crowded reception area, albeit with social distance markers and staff enforcement I personally found it uncomfortable & frustrating.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,It was worth it!!,"It’s not a cheap hotel and I think for a lot of people, it’s a one off, but i’m now not sure I can stay anywhere else in Singapore!   Our room looked out over the Gardens by Bay which was wonderful and of course the infinity pool was everything we hoped it would be. We didn’t realise how long the opening hours were ( 06:00-23:00 ) so we visited the pool 3 times on a one night stay just for the novelty of a 10pm and 7am swim!  We dropped our bags off at the hotel around 10am and was pleasantly surprised to be checked in early, though with Corona Virus the hotel was significantly quieter than usual but still very much appreciated.  The one sour point was we popped up to Lavo, the rooftop bar and restaurant, for a cocktail before heading out for dinner. All the tables with stools…",Mar-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,4,A weekend to remember!,"Marina Bay Sands was such an amazing experience and I am so glad we did it. We had a deluxe room on the 44th floor and it was amazing. The bed was comfy, spacious and had generous facilities. We absolutely loved the machine operated curtains - we would lie in bed and look at the Singapore skyline and then press the button when we were ready for bed.  The service was excellent - although incredibly apparent that they were over servicing in return for tip which made it slightly disingenuous and uncomfortable (we always tipped the staff). Room service drinks are eye-wateringly expensive, but to be expected. We had room service breakfast one day which was divine. We ordered for 9am - my boyfriend went downstairs at 8.45am to the shop and came back up at 8.58am to find the staff…",Mar-20,,

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,1,If you want to sleep in a mall...,"If you want to sleep in a mall with a cold ambiance and rude staff look no further than Marina Bay Sands...no one will greet you when you arrive and if you want a computer to check you out when you leave you'll have found the right place. Also, you too can have an over priced entry (incl drink) to a rooftop bar that allows you to experience social segregation at its finest but don't dispare - when you finally get to the top you get to find out that the entry fee, that ""includes a drink"", doesn't actually cover TAX and SERVICE CHARGES but don't fret the irritable staff will be happy to not explain this to you at any point of your stay, just look for front of house ""guest liason"" named Nas for no extra info.

Marina Bay Sands,Mar-20,5,Didn’t Disappoint,Wow. Definitely get a wow here! Checked in a bit early - reception said they’d email as soon as the room was ready but never did - has to go back later and ask again. City view suite 4750 - stunning is the only word necessary! Expensive hotel (but you know that when you book - for price of room would have expected biscuits and other mini bar items to be included. Expensive city - VERY! Staff great and friendly. WiFi - 3 star.  Sophisticated? I’d say ‘mass sophisticated’ as it is a big place so you don’t get any personal feeling special vibe.

The room is HUGE for singapore size, as big as the RWSentosa Equarius hotel, and Nespresso coffee machine was provided, fully stocked fridge and a sofa for relaxing and enjoying the large window view.

As the name suggests, the key feature is the amazing city view, enabled by floor-to-ceiling glass windows.  Room was amply sized for two, with a king bed, sofa, and wardrobe.  Drawer space seemed designed more for jewelry than clothes, but we improvised.  Bathroom was large, with a decadently spacious shower area and beautiful tub.  Guests should be mindful of the tile floors, which can be treacherously slippery when wet.  Service was friendly, and unexpectedly prompt, given the large casino-like atmosphere.  Club level includes access to the 55th floor lounge with great views and an extensive breakfast buffet.  Access to Marina Bay shopping and Gardens By the Bay is extremely convenient.  Will definitely consider…",Feb-20,,

Our view overlooked Gardens By the Bay which was amazing both during the day and at night.  The club was well worth it.....breakfast was very good as were drinks and canapes in the evening.  The pool on the top of the hotel was spectacular.  The hotel is a 1 to 2 km walk from plenty of good restaurants and local attractions.

Marina Bay Sands,Jan-20,5,Worth at least a one-night stay,"Due to the price, we opted to stay elsewhere during our trip, but treated ourselves to one night here in a premier room overlooking the bay.

We didn't have any trouble finding loungers, although we stayed on the adult-only side (west side) -- the side with kids might be more crowded.  Friendly staff and a good food/drink menu poolside.

Rooms are well-appointed and the epitome of luxury, with automated curtains and subtle, sophisticated lighting. The bathroom is the real stand-out though, with a gorgeous stand-alone bath in its own wet-room space. Then there are the views.

The pool on the top floor is amazing - huge, fantastic view of the city and Singapore is just great! Breakfast at Lavo was very good - several options, side of the pool. And the hotel has a casino and a huge mall attached to it - you can go using the stairwells directly. There you will find shopping attractions and many places to have a meal.

The Huge ship on the top is the main attraction of this hotel. yes, it’s the infinity pool.. but let me tell you something.i think this infinity pool is just over rated. (Spoil alert) Stay - Silent and peaceful :-) Food - Excellent :-) Staffs - Superb :-) Lobby - CROWDED :-( Amenities - Great :-) we had spent 3 nights in this huge hotel and we stayed in a room facing the gardens by the bay. the view from our room was great, specially at night when the garden comes live with all the color lights.

Although this was during the Corona Virus outbreak we feel totally safe with checkpoints at the entrance to the hotel taking our temperatures and all the guests.

The rooms are large with all the facilities you would expect of a five star hotel. The views out of the rooms are either towards the city skyline or Gardens in the Bay, both sets of views are awesome.  The swimming pool and roof top bar are amazing and the views are phenomenal.

During my 4-night trip to Singapore, I only stayed here for one night. I wanted to splurge, so I went all out and booked a room on the executive floor. I had expedited check in and was able to get into my room a few hours earlier than standard check in time.  The hotel itself is enormous, which comes with the good and the bad. The good is that there are plenty of restaurants, places to explore and things to do. The bad is that it is very difficult to offer top quality service when there are so many guests. This is a nice hotel but do not expect to get the same level of service as you would at Mandarin Oriental or Raffles. However, I must say the service in the…",Dec-19,,

The waiter offered sparkling wine or rose instead which were much lower cost than champagne. This is unacceptable of a 5 star hotel which we still could not believe it happened.  The breakfast food was of the standard of a 3 or 4 star hotel - very limited options and the quality was average/below average. A very disappointing breakfast quality/experience at a 5 star hotel.  If possible, guests with club access should have the option to have breakfast at the pacific club. This is the usual for other hotels. Understand there may be challenges to implement this during COVID times but hope it can be considered given the higher price paid for club privileges.

Our dietary needs were accommodated, and William also went out of his way to personally deliver the bento sets as we were worried about delivery delays. We really really appreciated his help with our extremely last minute order (it was placed for next day delivery).  The food arrived in thermal bags, and was very well packaged.

The room had a huge bed with the softest pillows and perfect mattress which enabled us to have to best nights sleep.

Easily accessible to shopping centers around but again due to covid restrictions if you walked back after 10 pm you can only go thru the main entrance and all the links from shopping centers are closed.

The hotel appeared to be one of the few hotels which came under the spotlight for long queues when they started to accept staycations on 9 Dec, apart from Grand Park & Hilton to name a few.

I stayed in the pacific club room, with pacific club access and the amenities were equal to or exceeded any other ‘club’ offering in many other hotels in Singapore. I travel here 2-3 times a year and have sampled several.  To be fair to people considering this hotel, the room size is very good for a ‘club’ level room, the bathrooms are ‘original’ and I did have an issue with a broken toilet seat and the shower mixer setting control which was faulty, but maintenance was on to it within minutes and both were repaired/replaced promptly, (I was on the way…",Feb-20,,

They tried to make amends by giving us a late checkout and a bottle of wine which I appreciate but they also did not deliver on other promises made prior. They mentioned setting up the amenities for the room and nothing was done, when I shared this with the manager, they sent a box of chocolates- sigh.

The amenities were all first class and it very quickly showed why it is a 5star hotel. As with a top class hotel you expect to pay a bit more for food and drink, but to be honest it wasn’t much more than bars and restaurants around the city. Our room on the 21st floor gave fabulous views of downtown Singapore. The bed was very comfortable although I was that tired after the flight I would have slept on a wooden bench.

I can't even begin to describe the breakfast, there was so much to choose from that there was no way to try everything, and everything was really good. The pool area was very nice, with a poolside bar.

A week before checked in, I have read online news reported the long check-in waits and quite worried that we would face the same situation.  So I wrote to Pan Pacific to show my concern and they promised that they will try their best to minimize the queue.  On my check-in day, I arrived at Pan Pacific hotel around 11 am and noticed that there weren't any long queue and the front desk staff Ms. Rissie attended to me and help me with the check-in. The process was smooth and I was able to check in around 11:20am. The room allocated for us was what I want with the nice view and they even prepared a small cake for the birthday girl.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,5,Pan Pacific Hotel in the Marina Bay area,"An excellent hotel in the Marina Bay area of Singapore. The hotel has good facilities, the staff are friendly and helpful, as is everyone in Singapore. The pool and gym are well provisioned. The rooms are comfortable, well stocked and extremely clean. Only downside is that the breakfast is expensive at S$38 plus tax, but this is cheaper than the standard rate if booked in advance via the reception.   This is room 3124 on the 31st floor with a city side panoramic view.",Feb-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan-20,4,Disappointing start....beautiful hotel...fantastic location...awesome staff,"We had booked the Pacific Harbour Studio room months in advance and had requested 2 things. Early check in and room with balcony. Upon arrival around 1pm we were unfortunately told our room still wasn’t ready. How sad considering this room type gives you VIP status but couldn’t be ready after so much notice was given.  We then got our room eventually, and yes it had the balcony we requested, but it was completely outdated compared to the pics on the net which we used as guidance to book the room. Instead of a newly renovated room and bathroom, we got an outdated bathroom that looked like it was last renovated in the 80’s. The carpets as well were worn out and dirty. A reminder that we paid a pretty penny for this high end room so it left us feeling disappointed. The next day…",Dec-19,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,4,"Booked for 4 days, stayed for 1, but still a positive experience","My partner, baby and I booked the final leg of a holiday at the Pan Pacific. On arrival we were greeted in a very warm manor and despite arriving at 7am we were given access our room straight away.  This allowed us and our 4 month old to get some rest after a long flight from Africa. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in-bed, delivered in record time (a nice touch was being able to request the room service cart to be removed at the touch of a button).   Due to some breakdown in communication, we only stayed for one day, not the 4 nights I had booked. I explained the reasoning to the hotel manager and they agreed to issue a full refund and didn't charge us for the time we had already spent there (I offered to pay for that night but they insisted it was not required).

Long check in, and the Harbour Studio room was mostly wall view with terribly dirty windows!  Anyway, rang room service and asked for bucket of ice and water, but was asked to go to 1st floor breakfast area for the ice.  This is a 1st for a 5-star hotel!  Managed to get the ice from the breakfast area, but they said they had no bottled water and asked me to see the Concierge for that!  Concierge was doing double duty checking in guests. After 20 minutes of queueing the Concierge said, ""Wait, let me ask my colleague (porter) to get the bottle water for you.""  Shockingly terrible hotel with dirty windows, horrible wall views, and non-existent room service!!!",Dec-20,,

Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,5,Lovely staycation,"Great staycation experience, nothing that I would really fault. The hotel was organised in the way check in was done, prior email was also received received few days before check in of your check in slot. Upon check in, you can then make your necessary bookings such as next day breakfast slot and the high tea booking. Like the way everything is done digitally through their concierge app, I think it works well for most savvy travellers. I am keen to have my elderly folks book a staycation sometime soon so just a bit concerned they might feel lost.

I would like to specially thank Guest Services Officer, Abhi who helped us during our check-in by upgrading us to a better room at a higher floor! We were caught by surprise on this wonderful act and it was definitely a great experience. The cleanliness in the hotel room and the facilities is commendable as well.

Our room was overlooking the Marina Bay skyline and we were lucky that there was a fireworks display so we were treated to an even better view.

Have to talk about that breakfast buffet. Wow. A huge spread of food across so many different cuisines - lots of choice for even the picky eater. Dumplings, curry, rice, noodles, cakes, jelly, chocolate, the staples (egg, bacon, sausage, tomato, mushroom ...) and much more.

On returning to the hotel we were given our room keys. We had a club room with a birthday card and fruit basket for my husband. A plate of delicious cakes followed. Breakfast was buffet style with healthy options and chefs on hand taking requests.

And don’t forget the window not the bathroom that was in full view unless you closed the curtains or find the screen button! Lobby beautiful, bar quite nice, bartenders attentive and friendly.

The cocktails and light dinner option available up on the Club Level was really nice and there’s a great view from there as well.

The Harbour Studio lived up to expectations with glorious views over the Marina Bay and gave us during the Chinese New Year celebration, the chance to be thrilled with the fireworks from our vantage situation! Breakfast at the Edge was good with plenty of choices. The Atrium was also good for drinks or a small lunch. The Edge evening dinner is a self service buffet, with so much choice, the sea food bar stood out. The best for us turned out to be the Hai Tien Lo, Cantonese restaurant.

Please convey my appreciation to Sufian for his excellent service. He really went the extra mile to delight his customers. He offered us a shawl as it raining outside and my daughter used it. When he found out from my daughter that it was a belated birthday celebration for me while I visited the ladies, he presented us with a slice of birthday cake.

I request for insecticide and he told me not to spray as more roaches will come out!!   So what's the level of cleanliness does this hotel practice. I felt so disgusted. I'm not staying in a fly by night hotel. This supposed to be reputable one.   There was a hiccup initially as I'm the platinum member but was not given any welcome amenities till I've asked for it.

We also had room service one night....Hainan chicken and char kway tweoh were the best is anywhere in Singapore, and far better than at the hawker centres. Could not fault the hotel for food.

He accommodated our requests to help us take photos & I gotta say his photo taking skill is good. Our high tea was ended on a sweet note with special treat of their cake in celebration of my friend's upcoming wedding.

Definitely recommend opting for a high floor and a harbour view. The bed is so comfy that you can melt into it.   Had a go at their buffet breakfast. Big spread but it was a tad disappointing to find out that they had run out of cornflakes.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Mar-20,5,Fantastic Brilliant Wonderful!,We arrived early from A flight from UK and from the doorman onwards we felt welcomed and the staff were superb. We were booked into a Pacific Room and then upgraded to a suite. It was lovely. The room was clean and didn’t look tired as some hotel rooms do. We were on the 33rd floor and had a wonderful view of Marina Bay. We left our blind up at night. The view from there made you feel so good. The Pacific Lounge on the top floor is fantastic and worth paying for the room upgrade just to have this. We never made it to Afternoon Tea however cocktails and canapés in the evening meant we really didn’t need to eat out in the evening.   We ate Dim Sum one lunch time. It was so tasty especially the one with truffle in it!  Didn’t want to leave and will definitely be returning. Thank…,Feb-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan-20,3,? Is quality declining,"We booked city suite for 7 nights over NYE period and this is my third stay.   We just returned from Beijing (Hilton Beijing Wang Fu Jing) and the differences are obvious.  1. Our bathroom had mould.  2. The second toilet sink tap is leaking 3. Poor housekeeping standards - yes we have a 3 years old so I don't expect 100% as it is unfair , but I at least expect the the dirty plates are cleared , miscellaneous rubbish is off the table and at least the sink is wiped and cleaned. 4. We found the Edge buffet spread is always excellent- but perhaps due to high level of crowds- less personable.   We are slightly disappointed as we had an excellent stay last year but regardless  will always consider Pan Pacific Hotel due to its excellent location but I am not sure if I would choose to…",Dec-19,,

Got a high floor room facing Suntec Convention and Swimming Pool. Room and Bathroom were clean. Wish for a bathtub but I believe it's another type of room, my boy loves Bathtubs :) . Location wise, it's one of the best in SG. Hotel is linked to Millennia Walk, Marina Square and Suntec City, it's best for every type of traveler, be it local or tourists.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,1,What a let down for 5 stars hotel !,"Checked in for our 1st staycation but the experience is just unacceptable for 5 stars hotel. We stayed here before few years ago but it is not the same standard anymore.  Just to highlight few issues: 1) we checked in around 2 plus but the extra bed was not set up until 830pm after 3 calls to reception   2) killed 2 cockroach already  3) hairdryer is faulty  I hope the list of issues stop here   We had our recent staycation at Marriott Tang, it was a complete different experience.

Pan Pacific is near to the city and everywhere still looks pretty and great to us, especially the night view, this what makes Singapore look proud in it's own way.

Thanks Pan Pacific for the terrific view!",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,4,Sumptuous Dinner,"I was here for a Dinner & Dance function organized by our Police Land Division. I was impressed with the cozy and well-decorated layout of the hotel lobby and atrium. Just from the outlook and intricate design of the atrium, one must admit that this is a 5-star hotel.   Our Dinner and Dance was held at one of the ballrooms. The space for the cocktail reception was quite limited. There were instant photo booths and game machines to entertain the officers and the limited space appeared packed and crowded.   The ballroom was quite large and the stage was central. The sound system was excellent. The food was sumptuous. The Chinese set of menu comprised the following dishes:  (a)   Combination of deluxe appetizers (Vietnamese Spring Rolls, etc) (b)   Braised seafood with Shredded Sea…",Feb-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,1,Monetizing Coronavirus epidemic: Refuse to give refund/extend Hotel Credits after flights got cancelled,"In early Jan, 2020 we booked our stay with Pan Pacific Singapore (and a few other countries) for our Asia vacation in late March. As the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak became more serious, our flight from LAX to Asia got cancelled by American Airlines. Subsequently, our connecting flights in and out of Singapore also got cancelled/delayed as well. Every major hotel chain in Asia did not hesitate to provide a full refund back to my credit card due to the epidemic outbreak (all non-refundable rooms). Pan Pacific was the ONLY hotel that refused to acknowledge/understand the situation that we were in. I have worked with my travel agency and Pan Pacific for a full week now, providing them with evidence of my cancelled flight itinerary and any other documents they've requested. It is…",Feb-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Mar-20,4,Fantastic Club Lounge with Glorious Views of Marina Bay,"In March 2020, I checked into the Deluxe Balcony Room at Pan Pacific Singapore. Conveniently situated close to the Marina Bay area, the 790-room hotel offers easy access to Promenade and Esplanade MRT station as well as nearby shopping malls such as Marina Square and the sprawling Suntec City, with an air-conditioned underground connection all the way to City Hall MRT interchange station and the Raffles City shopping complex. Changi Airport is about 20 minutes away by car, while Marina Bay Sands is a few MRT stations away.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Mar-20,5,"Not just great promotion, but wonderful service!","I was informed of the free room upgrade promotion and quickly checked the website and called up the hotel to confirm (6Mar 9.36pm). The reservation lady wasn't very friendly. She was cold and did not seem interested to help me at all. I almost wanted to check out the neighbouring hotels, e.g. Mandarin Oriental, Westin, Ritz Carlton, Conrad, etc. However, I am really keen to celebrate my wife's birthday in their City Suites room, and that was why I can tolerate her poor attitude. She responded that there are 8 such suites in the hotel and it is better to check the availability at the counter upon check-in. On 7 Mar, I stopped by the hotel to confirm the availability of City Suites room. I was impressed by the professionalism of Rhea and especially the Duty Manager, Roxanne.…",Mar-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,3,Cleanliness could improve and please provide bedroom slippers,"My stay at the hotel was the weekend following the crazy 2.5 hours check-in process that I head about from the week before, which was around 12 Dec.   I have to comment that the hotel management did an excellent job in managing the check-in process following their experience. 3 days before my stay, an email was sent to inform me of a designated check-in time slot, and I’m encouraged to follow the time-slot to avoid overcrowding at the hotel check-in area. True enough, when I arrive at my given time-slot, there was no crowds in the lobby and I managed to checked-into my room within 30 min.  The room was a tad disappointing, there was a stale smell upon entering the room, and I could spot specks of dirt in the carpet.  What was also disappointing was that there was no bedroom…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,4,Turnaround for potential disaster,"This is my 3rd staycation during the December school holidays. We decided to give Pan Pacific a tryout this last round after having fantastic stays at its sister properties. Planning a staycation has been trying for us because we have to personally call the hotels of interest for room info and requests. That is because we have two teenagers with autism, so ensuring that we are guaranteed adjoining or connecting rooms is a definite must. We just cannot afford consequences otherwise. We were not very hopeful when we called up Pan Pacific reservations the first time because we were trying to secure rooms the following day, and was told that only the lower category rooms are interconnecting. However, when my husband called again, a patient and more informative staff helped us…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,5,Superb hotel and location,"Absolutely outstanding stay here at the pan Pacific!  Took a taxi from the airport here - took us around 20 minutes ish and was around the $25/30 which was great  We had a twin room with a balcony and found it to be spacious, clean and more than comfortable  The shower was huge and had 3 shower head options! Provided toiletries were lovely too  The hotel was ideally located for us. Around a 20/25 minute walk to the marina bay sands or a cheap enough taxi ride elsewhere, here’s where we rode to:  Zoo - $28 Universal studios - can’t remember exactly but was less than $20 Airport - $25/30  The breakfast choice was excellent. A buffet style with everything ranging from waffles, to eggs cooked anyway fresh to order, to noodles, to pastries, cereals, fruits and breads. All fresh as…",Feb-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan-20,2,Don't Expect a 5 Star Hotel - Families looking for 5 star - Stay somewhere else,"We are a family of 8 travelling through SE Asia for 6 weeks with 2 parents, 2 grandparents and 4 younger children (3,5,8,9).   Being our first stay in Singapore, we weren't too sure where to stay to maximize the walking to attractions, restaurants, and malls. My wife and I couldn't book the 'front' bay hotels as the only rooms left were $1500/night and we couldn't justify it for the 1 block difference in distance.   I mistakenly booked the wrong dates for 1 of the 2 rooms directly through their website; one club suite and one 'regular' room. The grandparents are leaving back to Canada and we are continuing to stay in Singapore for a few days. I called immediately after the mistaken date was booked, to be told nothing could be done and to send an email. The hotel would not allow…",Jan-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,2,A room with a great view marred by disappointing food and service standards,"The room was very decent, but similar to other 5-star hotel club rooms that I've stayed in - comfortable, and clean. The view was fantastic, as it was a Harbour Club Room. My main agenda was actually chilling out in the Pacific Lounge and that was disappointing for me. Firstly the air-conditioning in the Pacific Lounge could be adjusted slightly for the afternoon when the sun was streaming in. But the most important aspect of the lounge is the service. I do not blame the staff at all, as I believe they might be  overwhelmed. But the lounge was less than half full, I believe in part due to the hotel's safe distancing measures, so I was surprised that they weren't coping. Both times (afternoon tea and evening canapes) that we sat down at our tables, it was a good 10-15 minutes…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,1,Disappointing Stay,"Upon arrival, our encounter with the entrance bellboy was already a first impression let down. He blatantly ignored providing any assistance, while my husband unloaded all our bags from the car and had to then approach him for the check-in procedure.   Check-in was a nightmare. We queued up with our 1 year old and 4 year old for over 30 minutes. Ironically, there was hardly any queue, we were actually just next in line. A line which unfortunately never moved for 30 minutes, a very slow process indeed.  Once up at our room, we were greeted with a pretty decent space and a lovely view. As a result, we tried to ignore those small blunders however Pan Pacific did not make this easy at all. Amenities were limited, even though we had specified 2 adults and 1 child, 1 infant during…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,5,Harbour Studio :  Room with excellent view,"Booked a panoramic room for a staycation during the weekday. In fact changed a weekend stay to a weekday one. Glad that I did the change, as I started to read news of long check time due to year end bookings.  Checked in 30 min before designated check-in time. Was fuss free and without queue! Choose the complimentary upgrade to Harbour Studio and was impressed with the view! Was given the 31st floor by friendly receptionist.   Room is spacious, classy and decked in dark wooden hues. There is a large moveable table complete with a Herman Miller work chair. Small bar counter with espresso machine where you could enjoy a cuppa looking at the wondering view overlooking the Bay and financial district.  Bathroom is huge as well with a separate bathtub, shower and toilet.   My kids…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,1,Cockroaches infested room / self service ice bucket,"Checked into Harbour Studio King room on 13 to 14 Dec 2020 for staycation.   1) Cockroaches were seen crawling around my room. Managed to video it but unable to upload video on TripAdvisor (as TripAdvisor only allow photos upload). This is absolutely unacceptable for any hotel. It shows how dirty this place is! Would you sleep in a room infested with roaches?! Made a complaint and was offered to change room.   2) Called for a bucket of ice and champagne flutes. Was told that $10 is chargeable for the service. If I want it free, I will have to get it at the cafe on level 1 on my own. Can you imagine hearing this from a 5 star hotel?! Best thing is, I was told that they do not provide ice bucket after 10pm as per their hotel policy as they are discouraging drinking after 10pm. I’m…",Dec-20,,

Huge bath and amazing view of Marina. (Though I keys were only available after 4pm).  MISSES: Ordered the Angus Beef Burger from their In-Room Dining Menu. Had good ones before in Pan Pacific Beach Road and Pan Pacific Hanoi. Pan Pacific Singapore's however was disappointingly dry and tasteless. They can do better with the fries too. And this for 41SGD (with GST).  Breakfast - Breakfast was served at Edge, even for Pacific Club guests. I was told at Reception that a separate menu will be provided for Club guests and can look forward to a Champagne breakfast. But instead, you get to order from the standard ala carte selection only.…",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Aug-20,1,MOST AWFUL EXPERIENCE,"We have been ordering prepaid take-away meals from Pan Pacific for past 3 mths, it suddenly turned incredibly horrible on our takeaway collection dated on 22 August.   7 staff standing outside hotel lobby looking away when 1 junior staff simply informed me that our collection would be delayed by at least minutes for No Reason, Without any apologies! In the meantime, she attempted to chase our car away!   In summary, I gathered that treating regular supporters as pests is Pan Pacific Singapore's Philosophy?!   I thought F&B outlets would be hungry for business during this pandemic period, although dine-in option is open for now, I wish to know if Pan Pacific Singapore F&B segment has exceeded their sales target and started driving customers away!",Aug-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,4,Old School Luxury,"The Pan-Pacific Singapore, I daresay the flagship property of Pan Pacific Hotels Group (which has now recently expanding their branding to include Parkroyal Collection) is reminiscent of old school luxury that is not typical of todays 5 star hotel environment.  Contemporary it is not, traditional more like. Big grand lobby with a view straight up to the ceiling (30+ floors). Property seems large and grand upon first glance.  Check-in:  Quick, and improved such that the paperwork is on an iPad. Coming in during the period of COVID-19, a quick declaration was needed which did not take long at well. A $100 dollar (per night) deposit was required for my pre-paid room which is a norm for such hotels of this standard.   Room: As we were celebrating a special occasion, got a…",Feb-20,,

We loved this hotel and it was our favourite  of the hotels we stayed  at on this trip. It has very spacious  communal  areas and since we were last here has had a major upgrade  qnd was very impressive.  The rooms are extremely  comfortable  with excellent  bathrooms ours didn't  have a great view but it was a corner  room so was extremely  spacious.

Our rooms had a big balcony with 1 chairs and small table to allow you to view the amazing view of Marina Bays area ... we could see the Singapore Flyer, Garden by the Bay, Marina Sands resort, etc.  The pool and spa area was beautiful - I went on Dec 31 in the afternoon and there was no problem getting a private lounge bed under cabana.  Location is super convenient ... walking distance to shopping, MTR and Marina Bay area.  I love Singapore ... you feel very safe walking around at night.",Dec-19,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Feb-20,5,A most memorable experience,"The Pan Pacific must arguably be the premier hotel in Singapore. With excellent rooms, kind and courteous staff and first class service and amenities, it made my first business visit to Singapore an enjoyable experience  I shall be taking memory snapshots of the wonderful stay here and wishing you the best of luck to continue with your sterling efforts  Special mention must be made of Mr. Shawal Bin Musa who very kindly assisted me on one occasion  Regards Mani Venkat",Jan-20,,

Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan-20,5,Staff Assistance,We were very happy with assistance provided by Shawal Bin Musa when we checked out at Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel. We have always had excellent service each time we have stayed here because of its central location to the city.,Jan-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan-20,5,Pan..tastic!!,We have just spent 3 nights in the Pan Pacific and what an experience - the surroundings are beautiful but it is the staff in this hotel which really make the experience extra special. I must give a special mention to Shawal Bin Musa who saw us struggling with luggage and went out of his way to help us - I must also mention the staff in the breakfast room at the Edge restaurant who greeted us every morning with great courtesy and a smile 😊  the location of the hotel is great and it is only a small dander to Raffles for the essential Singapore Sling!! would highly recommend this hotel.,Jan-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,5,Wonderful experience,"Pros - Wonderful bed - Good spread of afternoon tea - Nasi lemak is good for breakfast - Balcony view of the marina bay is wonderful - Mini bar is empty (bring your own drinks) Cons - No slippers - TV in the room is a SMART TV but their software make it a normal TV  - Could be more clear with afternoon tea and breakfast that is a alacarte buffet spread - Checkout process was bad. There were extra staffs stood around reception area but they seem to be just wondering around. I flashed my room card (obvious to checkout) but they ignored. Had to wait and queue to checkout. - Calling them for any service require a fee of $5  TLDR, 5 star hotel with 2 Star service.",Dec-20,,
Pan Pacific Singapore,Dec-20,2,Be warned - Cockroach issue!!!,Please be warned - the Pan Pacific has a cockroach problem. If you look back thru reviews it’s been an issue for over a month.  Christmas staycation initially ruined by this additional guest in the bed! Manager upgraded the room - but was hard to relax for remainder of the stay. Paying for Club Access has always been a highlight and didn’t fail again this time (from a staff perspective) but sadly it did not live up to high quality expectations for breakfast in the Edge - food was cold and felt staff were overwhelmed (we opted for Starbucks for the rest of our stay). As a regularly customer - there was a noticeable difference this time. Completely understand Circuit breaker probably lead to a reduction in staff but sadly their standards have been lost with them.

My partner and i arrived at the hotel at approximately 3.15pm on Saturday 12/12/2020 to check-in, knowing that the check-in timing was 3pm. We were met with a line of approximately 300-400 people. Even though most of the counters were open, each check-in took approximately 10-15 mins.   We waited in line for 2 hours.

Only after we checked in, we realized that there are many more things to appreciate about this hotel apart from location and connectivity. To begin with - extremely helpful staff in the front desk and concierge willing to go that extra mile to help their customers. Secondly, their service desk - you need something just dial 0.

His friendly and approachable demeanour certainly added to the warmth of our stay.",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Mar-20,5,Excellent service but an expensive luxury,"We stayed a couple of nights in a marina bay view room as a stopover on our return to the UK from New Zealand.  The service at both the ground level checkin and the 4th floor checkout was exemplary.  We had a spacious comfortable room, terrific views, good bed, ample storage and a well appointed bathroom.  There was a note stating how precious the water is in Singapore so to be cautious in its use, however it took many minutes for the shower to run warm, so wasting a lot of water.  Everything about the hotel from the room thru breakfast to restaurant food seemed very expensive, even more so with a currently favourable exchange rate.  However we enjoyed a memorable and peaceful stay.",Mar-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",May-20,4,Hotel (Marina Mandarin) is not up to date,"We are staying since 2006 at this Hotel, when we are in Singapore.  This Hotel was very good, the service was excellent, but from 2006 to 2015.  Last 3 visits were not that good.  The rooms were in need of renovation, and unfortunately the services were also reduced (for example room service). Like a four stars hotel.  But the employees were polite and good, especially Deven from concierge. He was very polite, helpful and his service was excellent. Nice guy from Malaysia.  I hope (now, new owner and management) that this hotel would go forward and will provide excellent Services again (as a five stars hotel).   I hope also that I could meet Deven (the guy from concierge) there again.",Jun-19,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Xmas Staycation,"Prior to check in, I have email on request for Birthday cake surprise and room amenities. All was confirmed via email and met on actual day.  Check in was seamless, room was clean (although there are couple of traces of the room deco that you can still see that remind you on Marina Mandarin).  Service was prompt and polite. There is still soft renovation work which you can hear faintly during the day.  Must try is Peppermint buffet lunch, although pricey but value for quality and taste. Only improvement will be the swimming pool is pre booked and slot allocated is limited. We have the last night slot available before pool closed so there is no clean towels at the shelf so we have to return the room battling the coldness.",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,4,Wedding Anniversary Staycation,"Went for a 2D1N staycation to celebrate my bronze wedding anniversary. Lobby is grand after the makeover. Check in was quick and the front desk staff Ms Doris was very professional and impressed us by doing her best to accommodate to our requests. Room was ok, bed is comfortable but the pillows are not to my liking. Breakfast servings are huge but selection is relatively limited.",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,4,Great Hotel for short stopover,"We booked this hotel as a family of four as part of a Singapore Airlines stopover package. The staff were very friendly and allowed us an early check in (8am instead of 3pm). Many attractions are close by, either walkable (eg Duck Tours) or a short bus ride away (gardens by the bay). The hotel has its own pool which really helps to fight the Jetlag after a long flight from Europe. Just what we needed!",Jan-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Beautiful Staycation,"Stayed 2 nights for a family staycation. Room was clean and newly refurbished. Comfortable bed, nice room amenities and beautiful lobby area - like being in a garden!   Staff are attentive and helpful and service was always prompt. Recommend a visit to the pool at night.

Kudos to the GM, Melvin Lim, for making the guests feel welcomed.",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Great stay,"Stayed for just a night! Room was very spacious and comfortable, had a balcony overlooking the pool. Everything was clean, room service/housekeeping were polite and helpful, breakfast ordered to the room was great too (just abit slow in arriving but staff were apologetic due to overwhelming orders for room-delivered breakfast). Very good experience overall! Location is great and is a good base for walking around the marina area and visiting the attractions.",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Feb-20,4,Great location,"This hotel has recently changed hands and will be subject to a considerable refurbishment over the next few months so I will excuse the very dull brown decor in the rooms. That definitely needs replacing. Having said that, my room was large, comfortable and the air conditioning worked, it overlooked the Marina Bay Sands hotel which must be one of the most bonkers buildings in the world! I also had a great view of the fireworks for Chinese New Year. The staff were lovely, very helpful and the concierge was extremely knowledgable. The breakfast was very good and offered plenty of choice. The location is great with direct access to a large shopping centre. It even has Marks and Spencer for British people feeling homesick. I liked this hotel and if it gets some colour in its decor,…",Feb-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Feb-20,4,Amazing Stay!,"I booked Marina Mandarin then found out to be ParkRoyal Collection.  They made an effort to let me know in advance regarding the change. The hotel is so convenient to most of the best tourist spots in Singapore.  Hotel smells so clean upon entering, relief from the hot humid temperature outside.  Big vases of flowers everywhere in the lobby. Reception at the ground greeted you and ensure you have a reservation then direct you to the 4th floor lobby for check-in.  My request for 2 single beds from the original king bed was accommodated, the room was not ready but the lobby has a good ambiance to wait and rest.  Room was overlooking the pool, beds a little cramp but manageable. Hallway going to our room a little bit dark, air condition was below desired temperature and the towel…",Jan-20,,

Checking in was quick and having arrived at 10:30 am. we were given our room early, which was great, having travelled from the UK. We also got a free room upgrade, due to the corona virus, it is quite quiet for the hotel. Lovely poolside area, bar was closed at the poolside, due to how little amount of people staying here, but could order food and drinks via a telephone at the bar. Lovely rooms, all with balconies, and great views. Good varied breakfast, which cater for all counties. Highly recommend it.",Mar-20,,

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,5,Honeymoon,The rooms were lovely and the view from the room was stunning. The pool was lovely but due to it being outside if it rains it cannot be used. The hotel restaurants and bars were very expensive but this is common in Singapore.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Mar-20,5,Our Special Day,"We held our wedding dinner at the Atrium Ballroom and were very pleased with the service and professionalism exhibited by all the staff to facilitate our special day.   A big thank you to Ms Xina for helping with all the planning and making sure that everything goes smoothly on the actual day. The hard work and dedication that she has shown us throughout our wedding planning made us feel reassured that everything will go smoothly without a hitch, which was really a blessing as the both of us do get 'panicky' from time to time as we get closer to the date.  Also a big shout out to Mr Sara for making sure that all operations on the actual day went on smoothly without any issues. Our guests had feedback to us that they were very pleased with the food and service for the event, and…",Feb-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,3,Great stay until departure day,"Hotel and staff were great however, it did not end very nicely. On our departure day, we went down to the bell boys(men) and ordered a taxi. We waited in line with other guest and then the taxi arrives. On of the employees said there will be a 10% surcharge, which was fine since the taxi from the airport to the hotel 2 days before, was only 21 SGD. We got in the taxi which looked more like a private chauffeured van, but didn't think much of it since we ordered a regular taxi and stood in taxi line in front of the hotel.  We got to the airport and the charge was 55 SGD (almost 3 x as much as a regular taxi). I have now contacted the hotel twice and no answer which screams bad customer service.  We feel ripped of and sad that the stay ended like that.",Jan-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,4,Convenient hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights recently. Hotel is a bit dated, but you can tell they have done some renovations to improve the look of the rooms. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean, although the shower is extremely small. For a large male guest it would be difficult to shower properly without hitting the walls of the shower. Hotel is very convenient, with direct access to the Marina Square shopping mall from level 4 of hotel and the Suntec convention centre / mall is across the road. The Esplanade MRT station is right next door so it was very easy to get in and around Singapore. Would recommend given how convenient this hotel is",Jan-20,,

This is our 1st time staying for year end normally we will book for the NDP preview. I must say, again, the staffs were super friendly and helpful. We got the breathtaking Bay View room which was over looking the Marina Bay Sands. And not to forget we get to see the fireworks from our room. Definitely a memorable experience. The kids had a lot of fun and we were so glad to stay before they were rebranded to ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay officially on 1st Jan 2020. We even received a small gift from them. Thank you for that!  Although we have stayed at other hotels before, we still end up choosing this hotel again because of the coziness of the rooms which comes with a great view, it is so accessible, Shopping centres just right…",Dec-19,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Sep-20,4,"Hotel with friendly staff, big rooms with balcony",I stayed in room 1118. Rooms are spacious with wide balcony overlooking the Marina area. Bathroom area is spacious and comes with a bathtub. Rooms are equipped with full amenities and toiletries too.  Ambience of hotel is classy and staff are friendly. The buffet restaurant at Aquamarine in the hotel outlet also serves a very wide variety of spread to suit anyone's palate. Hotel is also conveniently located near to shopping malls such as Marina and Suntec Shopping Centre.   My family and I enjoyed our stay here.,Dec-19,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Hero staycation,Firstly  would like to  thanks the organisation for the honouring healthcare workers  with  the complimentary stay.  Real positive  experience during our one night stay. It happened to be our wedding anniversary and  the  hotel was  so kind to surprise  my wife  with a card and lovely dessert.  I would like to compliment Mr Devan (hopefully i spell his name correctly) from level one front entrance.  He walk us to marina square mall entrance and  even help us look out for oncoming traffic as we were with our children and a pram.  Many many sincere thanks to the  hardworking team that tried to make our stay unforgettable  despite  minor  ongoing renovations and  challenges of safe distance rules.,Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,5,Amazing views over Marina Bay,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a stopover and it was great! I normally wouldn't book a 5 star hotel, but decided to treat myself and I'm glad I did. I upgraded to a Marina Bay view room and the view was spectacular. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom large with good water pressure. It was walking distance to almost everywhere I wanted to go (Gardens by the Bay etc) which was handy as I like walking, but also close to a bus stop that will get you near Sentosa if you want. I didn't eat at the hotel, but found the staff very friendly and helpful. I fell ill while in Singapore and the staff made sure I had plenty of water etc when I asked for some more. Would definitely stay here again, and really recommend the Marina Bay view. Next time I hope to take better advantage…",Jan-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,3,Overnight stay,We were a littler disappointed with this hotel . From the size of our bathroom that also had mould in the shower to the awful place we had breakfast .

Staff I interacted with were amazing. They were attentive and prompt in their services. They made this stay great, considering the troubles I had with the room.   Nay: Room view was that facing Suntec City and Pan Pacific. Can be quite loud with the traffic from below.   Got a room with a connecting door and I could hear the neighbours quite clearly, especially when there are kids in the next roo. Sound proofing needs to be improved.   I've been a cabin crew for almost 8 years and stayed in quite a number of hotels holding less 'stars'.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,5,Excellent Stay,"Stayed during New Year 2019/20.  Booked a premier room for a definite view of the New Year fireworks.  Stayed as 2 adults and a teenager, room was good but a little crowded with the extra bed supplied, but we managed during our 4 night stay.  Interior of hotel is really nice in common areas, however floor could do with updating a little dark and showing age.  Booked the breakfast which was good and plenty of choice and seating, no waiting for tables.  Pool area is nice, towels provided and bar area, night time swimming is lovely with all the little lights in the pool.  Rooms were expensive for what you got but that is put down to time of year.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,3,Average offering...,"An average offering for this class of hotel but with areas of disappointment. The hotel was in a good position and staff were welcoming and friendly. However, we felt more investment is needed to match other establishments we’ve stayed in. The pool whilst large and situated on a generous sun deck, was poorly appointed - only 6 sun beds were shaded under canopies and always in use (indicating a need) and no sun umbrellas - the only one that was there was broken!   With many international visitors arriving after long flights many are seen sitting wearily for hours in the main atrium until the 2pm check in. With the size of the hotel I feel a more comfortable area could be provided.  With so much choice in beautiful Singapore sadly this wouldn’t be a hotel we’d revisit but we thank…",Jan-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,5,Even better now,"I was a big fan of the old Marina Mandarin. The hotel was getting a little old. So I was pleased to learn Parkroyal is taking over this hotel. I had also stayed at the nearby  Pan Pacific a few times, and always enjoyed my stay there. I was keen to see how the newly renovated hotel is going to look like. I’m not disappointed at all . Checkin was smooth. I was allowed an early checkin . The lobby, which was my fav part of the hotel during the marina mandarin days, is now even mote stunning. The greeneries that surrounds the lobby is just beautiful. The room is simple and along the trend of the Parkroyal Pickering. Lots of natural light and simplistic in design. I like it. Renovation is still on going in some parts of the hotel. But I never felt disturbed by that. Service at…",Dec-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Jan-20,2,No show,"The hotel didnt pick up us at the airport. They wanted to check if we get a reward instead but they never came back to us. We paid for an upgrade but it wasnt worth it, the balcony is a joke only suitable for circus artists.  After the confirmation for the paid upgrade i was asked again if i dont want a paid upgrade.  They dont have fresh orange juice for breakfast (i asked twice). The only good thing inside the hotel is the american steak house. I recommend to avoid this hotel.",Jan-20,,

Next door two large shopping malls with plenty of places to eat.",Jan-20,,
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Dec-20,4,Almost perfect stay,"Had a weekend staycation with the famil: parents and 4 children. Rooms were perfect: big and spacious. However, we didn't not get connecting rooms or even one that is side by side even though we requested for it 2 months before. A little inconvenient as there were 8 rooms between us. The bathroom has a shower area and a bathtub. As a petite person, it was already quite claustrophobic to be in the shower cubicle. The bidet is very much welcomed. It was easy and fuss free to book slots for swimming and we managed to book slots for both days we were there. Reno work in still ongoing on the 5th floor. Thank you to the staff for being accommodating during check in and check out and for trying their best to lessen the waiting time. Would probably stay there again once the reno work is…",Dec-20,,

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Mar-20,3,Disappointed,"This is our first stay at this hotel. While it's understandable that they would need to close the club lounge for renovation, I don't understand the lack of any real food in the atrium lounge that has replaced it, during afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Looks like it's a very literal interpretation of ""tea"" and ""cocktails"". Quite a contrast to the other Parkroyal hotel we've stayed at (Pickering).  For anyone looking for a staycay option during this time, this is not recommended.",Mar-20,,

We managed to recover all the items and found out exactly what happened within a few hours. Very fast considering we are not sure where the items could have went in the hotel. Kudos to the team!

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",Mar-20,4,Great Stop Over,Let me say outright that all the staff including senior managers were very friendly & helpful & that for that alone we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stop over. Our room was clean & airy (the shower cubicle had black mold in bottom corners which given the care elsewhere was a pity & an unnecessary negative) The breakfast buffet was outstanding and again staff could not do enough for you. The pool area is very nice but no facility to get a meal or a drink which is a shame. We came back to the hotel one evening at 2315 & their was no bar or even a place to sit & chill with a night cap.  Would I say it’s 5 star no ( with a few tweaks it could be). Is it value for money yes. Would we stay again absolutely.,Mar-20,,

There was a little bit of confusion reservations wise, which was expected.  Got a triple room which was a little tight due to the extra bed.  All in all, the location is top notch, right next a shopping mall with tons of restaurants and shops.  Walking distance to many attractions.  Good breakfast spread with a ton of choices.  Hotel seemed a little tired though.  I hope with the new management, there will be some updating.  Looks like the property had better days.  Lovely lobby.  Needs a good renovation though.",Jan-20,,

There was also no wheel locking (i.e the beds could easily split apart in the middle of the night. This is a serious child safety issue) - It took about almost 2 hours for them to finally confirm whether they can fix the beds or  change or change a room.

Perhaps it was because we stayed during the National Day long weekend, there was a crowd at the Lobby Lounge when we went down for afternoon tea and cocktail/canape. Afternoon tea was a nice selection of pastries, sandwiches and scones, paired with a palatable champagne - Veuve Clicquot.

Shangri-La Singapore,Oct-20,4,More information should be given,"Here on a staycation with my 2 kids. Room was spacious and clean. Above expectation.   I was early and was at lobby at 230 pm, however the room was delayed and only available at 330 pm. Hotel was nice to give a free upgrade. I appreciated that.   As the indoor and outdoor playground required booking, this was not communicated to the guests.   While i was waiting at the lobby, i could have made all the bookings. By the time i tried to make the bookings at 4 plus pm, all slots were booked in both e outdoor and indoor playground for both days.   And bookings can only be made upon check-in.   Thus, my kids were extremely disappointed.   So note to parents: book early asap upon check in.",Oct-20,,
Shangri-La Singapore,Dec-20,5,Great family staycation in the Valley Wing,"We had a wonderful staycation at the Shangri-la Orchard. We were glad we chose in the Valley Wing indulgence package as it really made our stay particularly luxurious. We were there for my birthday and the staff kindly arranged a free cake. We took our toddler daughter who enjoyed Buds and Splash Zone (though she was disappointed to find out that most of the water slides were for 4+). We really appreciated the outstanding service and Le Yi who served us in the lounge was particularly friendly. The massages we had with our package massages were very good.  We are vegetarian and although they had options in the lounge, it was a bit limited and they did not create additional dishes to compensate for this (as they did at the Ritz), which would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, we…",Nov-20,,

For this reason, my husband and I would like to thank specifically: Bernard who every morning at the swimming pool takes the time to greet us and a lot of other people while checking everything is alright at the same time.

What an indulgence it was - we had access to the lounge with daily afternoon tea and evening canapés along with UNLIMITED Moet champagne and cocktails. In addition it included a 90 minute massage at the Chi Spa. I would say go ahead pay that extra $200 per room just to upgrade, it’s so worth it!   The rooms were spacious and clean. Bathroom was huge and plenty of wardrobe space. They had set up balloons and cake for my friend which was a lovely touch.

The bathroom facilities were excellent with good quality toiletries.  The Horizon Club was just what we needed after a flight from the Uk and it really was our home for the three night stay.  The quality and variety of food and drink available for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner was very good.

We had a very special private dinner celebration at The Orchid Diner de Fleur inside Shangrila by Chef Hun. He prepared a very exquisite 5 course set menu that really set the tone for the wonderful evening. Not to mention,  we were pampered by the great service of Steven.

Kudos to the receptionist whom attended to us when we came earlier for check in and the staff arranged for an upgrade to a bigger room for us (with no extra charge). She made this special arrangement so that we won’t have to wait too long (originally we booked Garden view) for the room to be ready and hence we were able to go into our upgraded room right away.

Couples retreat option is definitely the best value for great quality including the 90 minutes massage, high tea and canapés. Not to forget the rose bubble bath my friend managed to try was also included in the price.

On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised with the open, inviting decor and atmosphere.  The check in procedure was prompt, pleasant and professional. The space is beautiful, especially for a city centre property, although our autistic son did struggle with the way sound travelled around the space (This is unavoidable because of its design but we were able to avoid further distress as after the initial check in we used the Club lounge service centre).

We paid for access to the horizon club..certain parts of the horizon club have very noticeable sewage smell every day we have visited so far...it’s terrible. 2. Disappointing that multiple items on the pool menu aren’t available: today for example, both Rose wine options weren’t available and none of the four smoothies on menu were available. Service around pool is often slow: drinks arrive warm and food sometimes cold.  I’m happy to pay for a top hotel, but I expect good services and facilities in return.  I will raise these concerns with the manager",Jan-20,,

Your staff Arnold was very friendly and gave us very good advice regarding Buds and Splash Zone. I must say Arnold made a big difference and helped allay some fears as we read about overbooking of buds and splash zone.   Buds is the indoor playground, and the staff there were very friendly to my kids (3 and 6), even remembering their name.

The king size bed is definitely a good excuse for slumber most of the time. The bathroom has a roomy shower and bathtub (yes! not many hotels have this feature nowadays).   The meals are well planned, wholesome and healthy except for the daily soft drinks which it is a welcome treat at times.

Although the children's outdoor area was under construction, the hotel staff made sure that the pool area was brimming with help every where you turned. The pool was clean, and the pool chairs and towels were the comfiest I have ever experienced. We had our clothes picked up by a third party, and the concierge handled the entire thing and made sure our clothes were brought to our room.

It was such a great experience at Chi Spa that my mum claims it’s the highlight of her stay!   The room was tucked in the valley wing, away from the main lobby. With the package, we receive tea, cocktails & canapé + all day champagne and wine and valley wing lobby. For breakfast, we decided to go ahead with The Line instead of sticking to the Summit Room (even though it was more exclusive) because we wanted a more extensive spread!

Apart from a few minor changes, it's remained the same. It is still as impressive as my first visit. The staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and come equipped with everything you could possibly need. Great products in the bathroom too. I went to two of the restaurants this time and they were both excellent. The grounds/pool are gorgeous. My only pet peeve is that guests go to the pool very early in the morning and put something on several chairs to claim them for later and then disappear for hours, leaving other guests without a place to sit.

It was my birthday and I got a cake waiting in the room!❤️    We didn’t get to go to splash zone because the slots that we wanted were already full. It was Phase 2 in Singapore so the number of people that can get in is limited. We get to use the main pool though and my kids still enjoyed our stay!  The only downside is the food. Breakfast was the same everyday and the taste was average. I guess I just expected more from Shangrila. We also had In room dining and even that, the food I would say is not worth it. We stayed in Shangrila sentosa before and the food there was better.    We will still probably come back here after Covid is gone.",Sep-20,,

Shangri-La Singapore,Feb-20,4,Forest paradise in the middle of the city,The breakfast buffet was the largest we've ever seen.  It's just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service.  You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there.  Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room.  One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away.  The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There…,Feb-20,,

The breakfast, high tea, canapés and drinks throughout the day were all included in the package. It was all served in the Lobby or the Summit room.

Since we were there for rest, we enjoyed the amenities of the Horizon Club and was there for high tea and cocktails most of the time. I personally liked the concept of having a separate Family Corner for families that bring their children to the lounge.  I would like to thank Viola, Gian and Ella for taking care of us during our stay. No request was too complicated for them and they always served us with a smile.

It was service at a level that justifies the cost and the experience. We stayed in the valley wing, highly recommended for all the extras. The family play cation package added to the experience for our 7 and 9 year old boys.

The staff are beyond polite and helpful, the service is absolutely top class, and the food and drink offering is excellent. Perhaps I preferred the old bar that used to be at the top of the Tower Wing, but the new Origins bar off the lobby was a very pleasant place for a drink, and had a great range of drinks.

We also took breakfast in the Italian restaurant by the pool one day and we were not disappointed, very good and more quite.

Our room was spacious and had a lovely view out to the gardens and the pool. They decorated it for me for my birthday and had a little cake for me.

The first room I was assigned which was a pool side facing - a non-smoking room - actually smelled like cigarettes so bad that I asked for a room change (I am allergic).  The second room which was supposed to be a King Size bed was a room with two single beds pushed together not pool side facing, but finally the third room was what I had expected....King size, Pool side facing.  Location is good....close to Orchid Road after a little walk but the main areas were a bit distance.   A nice hotel overall but not 5 stars based on my experience,  As a side note, however, the staff was great...helpful, and friendly.  On my third room change the reception walked up to the room to…",Jan-20,,
Shangri-La Singapore,Feb-20,4,One of Singapore's best hotels,"Had a wonderful stay at Xmas. Service was excellent, breakfast was expensive but there was a superb choice of all kinds of cusines, lovely well-kept gardens, plenty of quiet areas around the hotel. Quite well located for Orchard Street and the Botanical Gardens although in Singapore's heat both are a little too far to walk to. Well away from the River, Chinatown, Little India & Marina Bay so you'll need a taxi or Metro to get to those places. We were not happy with the hotel's shuttle service to Orchard Metro station - there was only 1 small bus (minibus) an hour and this was woefully inadequate for the number of guests queueing for the service - that really must be sorted out! Needless to say drinks at the bar here were very expensive too. Overall, however, a very good place to…",Dec-19,,
Shangri-La Singapore,Mar-20,5,"The extra touches at Shangri-La, Orchard","We booked the Premium Balcony Suite for an overnight stay.  This suite has a spacious outdoor area with a jacuzzi and BBQ pit.  Understandably, BBQ food has to be prepared by the hotel - they will have their staff up there grilling for you.  We had some friends over to spend the evening together.  What was great was they found out it was for a birthday, and had the room decorated beautifully.  It was great!  The staff were warm and friendly.  And very helpful.

Shangri-La Singapore,Jan-20,4,What you would expect from Shangri-La,"There is nothing I could really fault, beautiful lobby, great bars, great service and lovely rooms. My only issue with hotels like the Shangri-La is the size, hard to get space at the pool for example, everything always felt a tad crowded. For the price, I would have preferred to stay at a boutique hotel where you would be in a more intimate scene.  Other than the size and traffic, there was nothing I would fault.",Jan-20,,

He particularly requested for our Indian food demands and made delicious Indian Masala Tea, Uttapam, Chole and all for all of us.

Also Doris from Spa, sales staff Dekura and Travel Reservation Team of Murni, Wei Qian and Poh Gek. They were friendly, helpful and served with passion and smiles. I was particularly impressed and appreciated few hotel's staff who stayed behind to help to find my niece's engagement ring in the lift at 10th floor.

I called for 2 care baskets at a time when they are full on orders, and when delivery was full and wasn’t possible anymore (and I also asked for a minimal customisation).

Very convenient experience at the pool, excellent food in all the restaurants including a great breakfast. Interesting grill in room formula or picnic basket in the garden. Service was much better than many other 5 stars in Singapore. Here they engage professional individual for most of the staff. Guests with little ones can enjoy the splash area and the kid's club.

The were not serving anymore breakfast although it is still before 11am. Manoj took the initiative and offered us some food and fruits that were still at the counter. Although we couldn’t choose what to eat but it was sufficient as we couldn’t ask for me. This is customer service at its best! NB: There were a few staff that simply ignored us. Worst, there was one that pretend that we are invisible despite waving our hand at him. Ask for Mr Manoj! Thanks for going for the extra mile. We really appreciate it!",Dec-20,,

Had room service out there one night and it was so nice. Breakfast is amazing. I usually don't like buffets but this one was great. The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood and you can walk to a lot of places from the hotel. I walked to shopping and the botanical gardens. The lobby area is really beautiful. My bed was so comfortable, bathroom was nice and I had plenty of storage in the room. The only negative about the hotel is that the pool was full of screaming children and service at the pool was pretty non-existent. I had to flag someone down to order a drink and something to eat.",Feb-20,,

Shangri-La Singapore,Jan-20,2,1 star in service,This appearance of this hotel was grand. However the services from check in and ALL the restaurants were AWFUL! We would get our main course before the appetizers. Our kids food would come out last. The waiters would forget to bring certain plates.. We had to make several reminders to waiters inquiring about late plates. Mind you asking for ketchup and waiting for it the length we did was noticeable.  Really sad as this is a 5star hotel with one star service,Jan-20,,
Shangri-La Singapore,Jun-20,3,Great room but there are better hotels in Singapore,We stayed in a Horizon Club deluxe room - was modern and comfortable with an excellent view. The hotel is ideally situated and great for those who enjoy a walk.  The newly updated HC was well refurbished but large and overcrowded with people and screaming children. It felt like we were in an airport lounge and we fighting for a table. The food and beverages were average at best; some of the red wine not even drinkable. The staff are friendly and efficient but sadly when the space is at full capacity at most times of the day - it doesn't really matter.,Dec-19,,

The quality of the rooms, the service, the facilities and of course the amazing staff, made it a totally memorable stay.  The staff were totally discreet and yet always helpful. Nothing was too much for them to advise, arrange, or help with. The rooms were immaculate, as were their enclosed gardens!

Hotel offers shuttle to orchard rd on the hr every hr up until 7pm. Best to be 15mins early in the queue. Prefer the tower block rather that garden wing. Location abit quiet as hotel is in residential area with not much to do around. Andreas at check is brilliant and an absolute assist to the company as is Syra from the Restuarant. What a pleasure meeting these 2 people. Taxi or shuttle required for any trips from hotel. Price can range from SGD 7 - 20 to furthest destination.,Dec-19,,

But doing a block booking for a seminar for overseas visitors was not as smooth as I had expected. I had chosen Shangri La based on my past great experience staying there and was disappointed with the standard of the booking system that I had to intervened on behalf of my overseas guests. I had envisioned that once the special booking code was allocated all my guests would be able to do their own bookings. Unfortunately there were hiccups along the way and I was embarrassed after having informing them this is one of Singapore's best.Luckily once everyone arrived the seminar proceeded well.,Nov-19,,

However, promise was not fulfilled. Called service center around 6.30pm on 6 Nov 2020 to find out if the cake is coming. Recived a snide reply that the hotel is having many celabrations & they have noted the request. Wait wait wait, no cake at all. I'm not hard up for the free cake & I do not celebrate birthday after the actual day.

I loved the horizontal safe - so much easier to access and a vanity unit with mirror and hair dryer - designed for female guests!

Her sweet and warm disposition really made our check-in enjoyable and delightful.   2. Mdm. Jenny, our room attendant. She made a point to pause her work when she saw us leaving our room to greet us and to find out if there is anything she could help while we are away.

Not sure whether it's because we are locals staying in a local hotel or now it's during COVID-19 period and services have to be somewhat compromised, the level of service falls short of my expectation in few areas.  Guests recognition is lacking as compared to my stay at Horizon Club Floor at many other Shangri-la properties.  It makes my even more appreciative of many overseas staff who were able to remember the guests' names.  We had breakfast at The Summit Room which is exclusive and happy with the ala carte menu.

I’m in on night 4 and will be checking out tomorrow, and still nothing has changed my mind about ever coming back again. Says a lot since this is our third or fourth stay with Valley Wing, and we used to love coming back to the welcoming environment and great team.

Shangri-La Singapore,Mar-20,4,Used to be the best in the world - not now,"My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri-la every two or three years since 1987.   For many years, it was the hotel of choice for professionals, especially when staying in the Horizon Club.   For the extra cost, one got excellent well-appointed rooms, and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas  On our recent trip, we found that the room had been redesigned, probably by someone who had never stayed there.  The bathroom is smaller, with the shower in a so-called wet-room area with a slippery floor, which could be dangerous.  A former feature used to be the full size bath-tub in which one could relax,  but this has been replaced by a small steep-sided one which is difficult to get out of.

Shangri-La Singapore,Feb-20,2,Disappointing experience,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel with our 2 grandchildren, twins aged 3, together with their parents and maids, checking into 3 rooms of their Horizon Club.  The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed.  The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a…",Feb-20,,

We were two adults with a toddler and a baby, and the combination of the splash zone and budz made it the first choice in family staycation options.   We booked the garden wing with pool view which came with a large balcony to relax on after the kids were asleep. The room itself was large, although the decor probably needs a refresh.

This goes beyond the childrens’ amenities - such as a dedicated check in area and the fabulous play and Swimming areas. We, as parents, really appreciate that they take the time to talk to and engage with her.   So, all stars as a family friendly hotel. And for travellers without children, don’t worry- the layout and space ensures that the hotel remains tranquil and there is more than enough space for everyone. The rooms are also most definitely clean and spacious, and for families, do request for s room with a sofa bed made up for the children.

Great service throughout starting from check-in, lifeguards at the pool, staff at the poolside bar, splash zone, buds and the restaurants!

Else we are more likely found in the main Orchard road hotels for a shopping staycation or Sofitel Sentosa for a relaxing stay.  One day prior to the check-in, I received an online check-in notification through their app and what surprised me was the incidental deposit the hotel has requested. For a 2 nites stay, I was asked to put up a $1.5+k deposit for incidental charges and this amount also included the room rate. Issue here is that I have already fully paid for the room rate a few months back and thus, why are they charging me for the room rate again?

My 18months toddler removed her shoes without our knowings and we left the restaurant after breakfast. New took the shoes and searched for us to return.

We stayed in a suite in August this year, when We dined at the hotel’s excellent Jade restaurant. We enjoyed that stay tremendously.   Aah! But the test of a hotel’s excellence is how the hotel treats the guests of its ordinary rooms.   We booked into the Courtyard room quite late on a Saturday afternoon.   We went out for dinner to return about 8.30 pm, to find hot water coming out of both the cold and hot water taps in the bathroom sink!   Naturally, the hotel reception hardly believed us; hot water from the cold water tap?!; perhaps, we were those troublesome guests agitating for a free upgrade. They send a technician to our room to confirm our plumbing complaints.   We were bumped up to a slightly larger…",Oct-20,,

Our room faced the atrium, was comfortable and well appointed. Pillows are very soft so if you need a firmer one, request it from the pillow menu. Meals at the F&B outlets and room dining at the property were good, especially the burger, and we had the impression that the Western fare was slightly better than the local ones, especially for breakfast. Although on the slightly pricier side, the food quality was acceptable for the price. The only feedback we would give is that the standard of the toiletries in the room could be better especially the hand soaps and it would have been helpful if the concierge desk was better attended.

The COVID-19 pandemic has not dampened the excellent, thoughtful service in the hotel though the new limited a la carte breakfast is quite disappointing and would benefit from a wider and more premium selection of items.   Rooms with a riverfront view are highly recommended, especially for stunning night views and the infinity pool enjoys beautiful views as well.   Afternoon tea (with refillable scones and savouries) was a stylish affair though the scones were small and rubbery and other items very small.

Tea is served in the Courtyard restaurant – a beautiful location inside the hotel. Tables are laid perfectly with floral decoration and quality china and silverware.  An ornate cake stand is provided laden with tempting savoury and sweet items – tasty creations unique to the Fullerton, we suspect.  There is a central buffet laden with further supplies if one is tempted to re-taste some of the more delicious items.   This can be more than just an afternoon light tea, if one chooses – the price is the same regardless of how many snacks you try.  A harpist provided gentle entertainment – but it’s worth noting that she plays only until 4.30pm.  A selection of teas are offered – co-incidently I…",Jan-20,,

The staff were impeccable having arranged a variety of surprises for my wife's birthday. the location of the hotel is on the river but try to make sure that you book rooms that overlook it as the other side looks out over commercial high rise towers. It has a small pool, again overlooking the river and is about a 15 to 20 min walk to the Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay Gardens. The nearest 'underground' station is a mere 5 mins away and there are numerous restaurants within 5-15 mins walk. Breakfast is extensive and has something for everyone.

The family package was just alright with 2 ice cream redemptions per kid and we had to remind the reception before my kids were given the passes.   The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping was friendly and helpful.  Service in general is efficient and warm.

We chose the hotel because friends had stayed there previously and recommended it to us. We could not have been happier with our choice as it is such a pivotal location in Singapore and so much part of the history of the island. We attended both of the free hotel-run complimentary tours i.e.The  Fullerton Monument Tour and the Maritime Journey Tour. Both were informative and interesting. Thanks to Bill who was excellent as our guide for both tours.

Most of my initial thoughts were correct but I came away thinking the hotel relies too much on its historic name and locale and should focus more on service and upgrading internal decor.  Pros The architecture and stature of the building especially lit up at night Buffets were great in the ground floor restaurant.

The room was beautiful and very clean, and I appreciate that the hotel provides glass bottles of water instead of plastic bottles.   We also visited The Lighthouse (restaurant) for the first time, and Anna and Khalid were great with their tips. Be sure to look out for them to get good table and food recommendations.

Room tip 1 : I personally prefer the Quay view room to the Marina View room here though the Marina View room is more expensive. The Quay view rooms feel closer to the water and the right angle allows u to see the colorful Boat Quay.

The whole experience was simply amazing. Starting from early room availability, fantastic service, a great room with stunning views to good food.

No drinks were offered whilst we waited.   We had club access as part of our stay. Whilst there is no buffet which we understood the offerings were the same each day.

On our day of check out, we got our girl to redeem her first and last scoop of ice cream. The Director of Front Office and Concierge Ops, Roszel, kindly offered us a more private seating away from the crowd so that our girl can enjoy her scoop of ice cream.

Sofa bed was about to give way, the springs were very flimsy.  Service was rather mediocre. Went at 2 p.m. for the welcome drinks at the courtyard but was told they are preparing for afternoon tea due to start at 2:30 p.m. Went back about 9 p.m. but was ""encouraged"" to takeaway.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Brilliant Hotel,"We were fortunate to have stayed in November for three nights on a B and B basis. The hotel is fabulous both inside and outside. Kate Joe on reception was outstanding. She was very very helpful with explaining what was in the hotel and also the local area. The pool area overlooks the Singapore river and is a must. Rooms were cleaned each day and the standard very high. Also we attended the the street food centre Lau Pa Sat which is well worth a visit. Drinks can be expensive in Singapore but many places have happy hours. Great location the hotel though. Fantastic light show on Marina Bay acroos the road.Would highly recomend. Taxis are quite cheap, and our advice is to use them if your dining out because if you walk you will find that you may be sweating when you get to your…",Nov-19,,

Pay for the Balcony Room, we watched the Light Show over the Bay, Sunrise Through the Marina Bay Sands'  Iconic Building, had a nice nightcap sitting on the balcony, & could enjoy the Merilion before the tourists arrived. The Historic Building is quite beautiful with an interesting history. The service was impeccable, from reception to busboy (fellows). Breakfast was round-the world  choices, all delicious.  Loved eating lunch in the atrium! Koi in the Lower Lobby. Well appointed room. We really enjoyed the Chinese New Year's Decorations, very tastefully done. Can not wait to visit again!",Jan-20,,

We were warmly greeted by Alan and Wayne khor and then brought to our private room for dining.  Lovely surprise seeing the room beautifully decorated with balloons and couple bears.   We enjoyed our lunch (very fresh and quality food). Ordered a rose cake for our anniversary celebration and it was light and super delicious.

The package came with a four course dinner. it was adequate, the appetizer satay was nice but the other food were average.  Breakfast at the lobby was good with a good selection on the menu.  Service falls short of a five star hotel. - The hotel sent a confirmation email after the booking. I requested for a DVD player (to play a scene it game) and a simple birthday set up for the room, and was told that a simple birthday decoration can be done and that the DVD player will be placed in the room.

Everything was first class: the room and public places absolutely spotless. All the staff were extremely attentive and friendly, smiley faces, especially the restaurant staff who made you feel like the only guest staying there.  Just two comments to make. It would be so much nicer to have tablecloths used in the Town Restaurant - rather than bare tables!  Secondly, we were tempted to eat outside but were put off by the birds landing on tables & eating food remains, and then the tables were only wiped over with a cloth by staff - with no sign of any disinfectant spray😳  The buffet dinners we had were superb. All the food was exceptional quality and served by the most friendly staff.  Thank you to…",Jan-20,,

We are 2 adults travelling with our two children aged 9 & 6 and the room was plenty big enough and the childrens beds had proper mattresses rather than sofa beds! I thought the room might be a little small being an older building but I was wrong! It was perfect.  The pool and gym were both excellent  although the pool was a little cold!

We had stayed at the Fullerton before and it was an obvious choice to return having been so well catered for previously.   This is a beautiful stately hotel with so much style and elegance. The building itself is so iconic and the staff are charming. Their hospitality and help is offered kindly and discreetly but is always readily available.   We chose a Club Room which comes with champagne breakfast, delicious afternoon tea with speciality Fullerton scones and real clotted cream and evening drinks with tasty canapés.

We grabbed their fantastic one night staycation voucher from their website and enjoyed a super relaxing night away to recharge and enjoy downtown Singapore. Breakfast included and $150 credit at their restaurants for F and B. We had dinner at La Brasserie Fullerton Bay Hotel. Service from Alan was exceptional and he took a photo for us and printed it into a card for our anniversary. View out over the water and MBS lights and lasers. Simply exceptional. Put our bikes in the back of the car and cycled through Marina Bay Gardens all the way to East Coast Park and back. Something we haven’t done in all our time living here.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,4,Honeymoon during COVID-19 (Marina Bay View Room),"The room was very comfortable. Bedding of top class. The toilet was very spacious. We had booked the Marina Bay View room for our honeymoon. We had informed the hotel prior to our arrival that we were celebrating our Honeymoon at the hotel and they were nice enough to have the room decorated and a little gift sent to our room after we checked in.   Due to COVID-19 guidelines, we had to book the usage of the facilities (such as the pool and gym) in advance. Failure to inform the hotel prior to your arrival meant that it was probably not possible to get a slot at the swimming pool. Lucky for us, we were able to get the pool to ourselves on one of the weekday nights.   The only downside that we felt was lacking during our stay at the Fullerton was their breakfast.

We were offered another room at an extra cost which we declined however he made us feel extremely welcomed and said we could make use of the pool, spa and gym area and have a shower before heading out to see Singapore. That simple gesture was very much welcome.   Once we were back at the hotel we were checked in and up to our room. I believe that we were upgraded without being told as I had booked an atrium room yet had a city room on arrival. The room itself was huge with double glazed windows so it was super quiet. The TV was enormous which was to match…",Mar-20,,

Service was excellent and professional but not personable hence 1 star off. Besides the checkin, we didnt have much interaction with staff. But Kudos to housekeeping staff! They made up the room well, good turndown service and topped up all the supplies including the teas. Another big star off for change in breakfast service - they changed the menu now to a set which was completely unsatisfying and small portion. When I booked the hotel, it was a la carte buffet - small offering but could order as much as u want. It was quite unfair for hotel to change menu within a week. Tried to order more but staff said ‘by right no’ hence I didn’t push it given his comment. Was starved after that. Wasn’t the adage a good breakfast for a good start of the…",Aug-20,,

I got all I need at the supermarket there and took a cab back which was around $6. Tip: you can find bath bombs at Lush for the nice tub in the hotel.  Breakfast was amazing. Great variety of choice and the staff at breakfast were full of happy vibes and extremely attentive.

They had ample day light and i had a room facing the bay (even though i would have loved the lobby facing rooms). So both inside and outside facing rooms would work fine. The location is ideal for visitors keen on a historic tour. The museums and art gallery are within walking distance. For the night Owls- Boat Quay and Clark Quay are a stones throw away. There are also plenty of restaurants at the bay area (unfortunately my 2 nights did not allow the luxury of the bay experience). F & B unfortunately was not up to my expectation and we could all blame it on COVID. Most of the restaurants were fully booked and we could not make last minute reservation.

The room was well presented, comfortable and clean; house staff were excellent and non-intrusive.

Were not dissapointed. The staff are amazing and their attention to detail is outstanding. We booked one of the premier courtyard view rooms which some reviewers have negatively commented on (as it only has internal views) but we really loved it and found it to be so comfortable and charming. All staff take such pride in their roles and particularly would like to make mention of Anne who checked us in and sent a little posy of orchids up to the room for us as she had heard me commenting on all the beautiful floral arrangements throughout the lobby.

We were offered an upgrade to the Fullerton suite with a very reasonable rate, which I totally agreed with the lady who offered to us - that was a wise decision which we would not regret!

Stayed in 2 Heritage Rooms that had balconies and a fantastic view of MBS and Clifford Pier area. Rooms are not big so if you are travelling with kids, book 2 rooms. We had an extra bed in ours which we got housekeeping to remove within a minute of checking in - too cramped. Staff are friendly and efficient as to be expected of hotels in this grade.

The breakfast buffet is excellent and caters for all tastes but can I suggest you have the chefs make you an omelette!!

Quality of food is commensurate with the price and a 4 course meal is perfect without getting you overly full.

It is close to transport connections within the city.   The staff and facilities are excellent with every conceivable amenity available.   Minor, very minor complaints, the courtyard rooms have a view of the interior of the building, it is built in a triangular shape therefore there is absolutely no view or natural light.    We had booked a king bed room which was in fact  (two singles pushed together) creating  a very uncomfortable bed ( a large ridge in the middle of the bed).

It really put our minds at ease. We knew the experience didn’t just come from guest cancellations as everyone was extremely natural in their helpfulness.  The room was beautiful, and the pool was a great size overlooking a park and buildings. The men that worked at the pool were just so lonely and took such great care of us.

The rooms are really comfortable and many have a balcony door for fresh air. This is a blessing not available in many modern, business oriented hotels.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,5,Fantastic Staycation,"Had a wonderful staycation at The Fullerton Hotel from start to end. Before checking in, we were assisted to ensure that our preferred pool, gym and dining slots were accommodated (due to COVID measures). During our stay, the duty manager Kate was also super helpful in ensuring that we had the best staycation one could have.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,My birthday made so much more special by Fullerton,"My boyfriend and I were out for my birthday dinner at Boat Quay and went strolling on the Cavenagh Bridge after. We felt like we needed wine to close the day and some mud cake would be great. That’s when we entered Fullerton with the intentions of splurging. We described them what we liked and they were able to get us something very similar. We couldn’t find a mud cake but they made an effort for a different kind which was great too. To top it off they took a picture of us, printed it and gave us a hard copy. In addition to birthday wishes they gave us 25% discount on the bill as it was my special day. I would love to go back whenever I visit Singapore next. Thank you guys so much for the hospitality offered. Junwei, Indran, Kim, Ellen and Aron. Thank you",Aug-19,,

The room was top quality and we had everything that we need. Comfortable bed, amazing marble bathroom, large screen tv with chromecast, safe, hairdryer and quality toiletries. Everyone in the club lounge were very helpful and friendly especially to our little boy... in fact all the staff were amazing, friendly, professional, and always with a smile.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Oct-20,5,Luxury time with sister,"My sister and I spent a weekend staycation at the Fullerton Hotel. We were very impressed by the friendliness of all the staff we met and particularly Kate at the counter who explained everything in details and showed us the way to lift.  The room was spacious and comfortable. And pool was nice, gym was good!! Different time slot was allocated due to current situation to avoid overcrowding,  make us feel more relaxing .  Breakfast provided was amazing too!!  We enjoyed our stay very much.",Oct-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Oct-20,4,Good quality stay.... but...,"Booked this hotel on a staycation package. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, customer service is excellent, however, there is just one problem....  The breakfast timing is provided at 3 timeslots, during check in, we were told we are able to come down anytime between the timeslots.  When we arrived at the breakfast area towards the end of our timeslots, we were told off by the restaurant staff that we need to come in right on the dot at the beginning on the breakfast timeslot we booked. This was not as conveyed to us when we checked in. Also, the attitude of the staff could be better, instead of showing us an upset face.  This incident really leaves a huge black dot in an otherwise excellent experience.",Sep-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,3,Famous hotel but...,"I stayed at the Fullerton on business for 4 nights.  The hotel is very well situated and extremely clean. The staff was very polite and helpful.  But my room was a big letdown. It look on the interior courtyard. Not very private, to say the least. It was at least renovated. When I did object to it, I was changed to another room, not renovated but at least with a more private view out of it's very small window.  The breakfast buffet was also a big letdown, especially after the Four Seasons Singapore who's breakfast buffet remain the best I've ever had anywhere in the world.  Lastly, getting a taxi from the front door was a challenge  throughout our stay.  I'll be back in Singapore, but sadly it won't be at the Fullerton. I would be tempted to try it's sister property, the…",Dec-19,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,1,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to staying at this hotel given it’s iconic exterior and fantastic location.   Unfortunately, we were incredibly disappointed. The decor and rooms are extremely dated and the entire hotel is in need of a significant refurbishment. The interior does not match the exterior at all and the layout is clunky, not easy to find the pool or rooftop bar. The food was also quite poor.   The staff were not overly welcoming and we found a used cotton bud on the floor outside our bedroom door.  In my view, this is not a 5 star hotel and certainly did not warrant the 470 pounds per night charge (which didn’t include breakfast).",Jan-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,The perfect Singapore base,"The Fullerton is one of Singapore's landmarks which makes it oh-so-easy to find your way home, wherever you are. It's right on the water and walking distance to many of the city's attractions plus there's a bus stop right outside. It's really beautiful designed - I loved the red lanterns outside and all the flowers in the enormous foyer. The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable with incredible bathrooms. And the service is fabulous. We had a late flight so were given access to the spa where we could shower and change just before leaving for the airport. Also loved the infinity pool on high.",Jan-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,CNY Dinner,"Come here for the Hot Stone Silver Needle Noodle with Truffle Meat Sauce before CNY ends. I was not disappointed.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Birthday Afternoon tea,"Atmosphere is lovely with beautiful music played by a harpist  Food is tasty with a beautiful selection  of teas.  Attentive friendly and professional staff. We were looked after by Lalikumau, Aldin, Miyako and Sherman. A great team. Made it very memorable for us.  When booking I added additional note of celebrating birthday.  I was surprised a delicious birthday cake was served to my friends for their birthday and we had our photo taken and was presented with a birthday card with the photo.  Food was amazing, there was even a buffet tabke if you felt you needed more desserts. What was served to us was more than enough. Was a beautiful surprised and very thoughtful to have a memorable gift given to us.",Oct-19,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jul-20,5,"Comfortable and Impressive place, and is worth staying.","We arrived the hotel before noon carrying suitcases.  It was too early for check-in, so that we asked frontdesk to keep our suitcases while we are out for a walk.  Hotel receptionist suggested the national museum nearby and passed me entrance tickets.  This was the first contact.  Two hours later, we returned to the club lounge of the hotel.  Our room was still not ready (too early), so that we decided to kill time at the cafeteria next to the registration desk.  Cups of coffee came to our table, and then the service person proposed us for free lunch.  We stayed club lounge and our stay plan include access to lounge, but their hospitality to hotel guests seem unlimited. We stayed the hotel for three nights.  The hotel is very historical but its Light House restaurant and the…",Aug-19,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Surpassed my expectations,"Stayed 3 nights at The Fullerton Singapore. Our beds and bedding were luxurious. The bathroom was spacious and beautiful. All the staff were so welcoming and greeted everyone. Staff were there to make sure you had a fantastic experience and offered extra touches. You couldn’t want for more at breakfast. The harpest playing in the foyer each afternoon was so lovely to sit and listen to. While there are magnificent views from the lighthouse restaurant or rooftop bar of Marina Bay Sands our room had a beautiful view of the pool the river and beyond. Great location close to Boat & Clarke Quay and MRT. Hint for travellers, download the Grab app, great value for booking a car and driver. More efficient than Australia’s Uber. Loved The Fullerton and so pleased I stayed there only…",Mar-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,3,Well-known landmark next to Singapore river,"Classic hotel stated inside the old post office right next to Singapore river.  Fantastic exterior and great location, close to restaurants and SMRT.  However, the room interior was a disappointment. We stayed in a club room. The furniture felt outdated as if they where from the 70’s, which did not match the hotels atmosphere. Our room was facing the bay, however the windows where small and placed very high up, which was a disappointment regarding (the possible) view. The room felt like living in a basement.  The bathroom was decent, including both shower and a bathtub.  In the lounge, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and snacks where served.  The staff where excellent. Great service.",Mar-19,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,5,Birthday staycation,"We had a great staycation to celebrate my birthday. We went to the steam room and sauna. A short time at the swimming pool.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Great value with excellent service,"We decided to try afternoon tea here in what we normally considered to be a more 'tourist' thing to do. Owing to the decline in visitor numbers the hotel are offering 30% off some dining options so it was great value. We paid under $100 for unlimited food and tea for 2 people - the food was more based upon an English traditional afternoon tea offering. The team were very attentive (Lalilumar, Camilla, Miyako and Aldin) and the overall service was exceptional.",Mar-20,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,The Fullerton Hotel is a wonderful place to stay spoil yourself.,"I was more than impressed with The Fullerton Hotel. The staff could not have been more helpful, polite and friendly. A special mention to Rafi Patani and Roszel Marop and all of the concierge, reception and pool staff. I stayed on my way to Europe and then again on the way home to Australia three weeks later. The swimming pool is just fabulous - get there early and watch the sunrise swimming laps - great fun. My room on both occasions was beautifully presented. On my return stay I arrived to find birthday balloons and a piece of chocolate cake including a candle! It's attention to detail and personal touches that make The Fullerton Hotel an exceptional place to stay.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Oct-20,5,Heritage room of Fullerton,"Stayed in the Heritage room located on the 6th floor. The moment I opened the door the views from 3 large windows and the little flight of stairs that lead to down to the bed, sofa, working table and a mini bar totally left me in awe! The room is so pretty and cleaned, though I know Fullerton is a very old building, I must say the place keeps up with the existing trend yet preserved the building's heritage. Service provided by each and every staffs that I had interacted with was top notch and consistent. Location of the hotel is fabulous and convenient. I will definitely recommend every tourist to stay here at least 2 nights if they would like to know more about the history of Singapore or just to be pampered by the dedicated hospitable staffs.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,4,Staycation,"My 3rd/4th stay with Fullerton Hotel. This time round things didn’t happen too well for us at the beginning. So a feedback was sent & I am so glad that the hotel immediately stepped up on the shortcoming, resolved my emotions & my family ended the stay on a high. Really very grateful to the staff who sees the value in customer service & ensuring that they keep up the standards of Fullerton Hotel. Still the pride of Singapore!   If you are going, make sure you visit the pool even if you have no intention to swim. Get up there to take an insta worthy photo! Really awesome view & background!",Nov-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,Comfortable,"A comfortable well located 4* hotel - more targeted at business travellers.  While the exterior facade is iconic, the internal lobby and many of the rooms are dated.  We asked to change room from a cramped and dated Marina facing twin and were moved to a modern interior facing twin which had recently been refurbished and was spacious and comfortable.  The room itself lacks any high end touches - the inclusion of pot noodles and stuffed toys in the room feels tacky - while the heated electronic toilet is just plain weird.  Overall nice but for the money there are far better value options in Singapore.",Feb-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,5,Favourite hotel in Singapore,"Love this hotel. Great ambience, beautiful restoration. Location is perfect for both work and play: Marina Bay can be accessed via underground walkway, and MTR is only 200m walk at 6 Battery Road. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable.

Always been to fullerton for their dinner buffet. My fav, fullerton laksa! The staffs are always friendly and polite.  Had a memorable birthday at Fullerton. My partner had requested no birthday cake in order not to waste food. So I was in a norm mode to enter the room.  A sweet and simple surprise by Fullerton team. Upon check-in, we were being upgraded to Quay room.   The room was clean and decorated with colorful HBD balloons. The view was great in the day and night for me to take awe pics!

The Premier Collyer Suite is beautiful and the extra bed is big enough to accomodate 2 kids. The room is clean and bed is comfortable. The service from the club lounge was great and our kids enjoyed the food and mocktail.   Breakfast was good but 1 hr of breakfast is rather rush when we have got kids and toddler with us. 2 hr for breakfast will be appreciated especially when this is a family staycation.. Rushing to finish up breakfast is not that enjoyable.  The pool is clean, prior booking is required to enter the pool. Swimming vest is also available for kids.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,A good experience overall,"Overall a pleasant experience because of the discounted price. Beautiful lobby. The room is comfortable with very soft pillow so might want to prop it up a bit. The restaurant, pool and perhaps the spa are worth a try. However the vicinity is good due to proximity to the Fullerton area and Fullerton Bay Hotel. Must try the Jade restaurant for good Dimsum. Try the lighthouse too for a good view from the top of Fullerton.",Aug-20,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,Historic building and old fashioned hospitality,"From arriving to departure they never put a foot wrong. The doorman (having read the name on the luggage tag) greeted us by name, which always gets me till I remember how they do it and the check out and handover of luggage at the end was just as smooth and friendly. The hotel reacted sensibly and proportionately to the Coronavirus (orange) alert: checking our temperatures on check in with a sensor ‘gun’, placing anti-bac gel dispensers by every lift and washroom and having staff continuously spraying door handles and tables with cleanser. On a brighter note, large comfortably furnished room with a fine quayside view. Fabulous breakfast and a stunning view from the rooftop ‘Lighthouse’ bar. Great position: walking distance from the financial district and (at a pinch) the Gardens…",Feb-20,,

Lucia noticed that I had only just joined the dinner, and immediately came by to ask me what drinks I needed for my meal.   The food selection was also amazing. There was a wide spread of variety for the food, chinese, Italian, japanese and even a grill selection. Definitely a refreshing change from the other hotel buffet restaurants that we had over the past few years.

I would also like to recommend Kate Reyes - duty manager, she did our check in a couple of minutes and very attentive to all our requests.

Thank you so much gays especially for Latin night parties.",Mar-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,5,Golden opportunity for staycation at The Fullerton Hotel,"The hotel staff never let it’s management down. There were smiles and warm at every encounter!!  Justin at the front desk was friendly and checked us in with much professionalism. He was helpful in making my sister’s birthday celebration a surprise in her room.  Room was exceptionally clean with the additional warm toilet seat cover as a bonus.  There are 2 elevators and only one can bring guests directly to the pool.  Great surroundings and hotel is so magnificent, standing out in the night !!",Nov-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Breakfast at Town — The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,"The breakfast buffet at The Fullerton is one of the absolute best I’ve ever encountered. All tastes well and truly catered for, and the omelette station is a particular favorite of mine.   A special word for Mei and Thiri, who made my wife, son and I feel completely looked after. A photo and card for our wedding anniversary was a lovely touch — we couldn’t be happier.",Mar-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Feb-20,4,Stately But Dated,"This is a fine, stately hotel that was a fortress and also a post office in a former life.   The location is ideal, very centralized. A short walk will take you to nice areas and vista, like that of the Marina Sands Hotel (with the surfboard on top).  The people — just like about everywhere in Singapore — are wonderful.   The facility itself and particularly the rooms feel a bit dated. The room layout is everything you would want, with all the amenities and also plenty out outlets. We liked the bed and loved the pillows but were disappointed in the carpet which showed wear. To me that is an indication of the extent to which the rooms are maintained. Not that it’s a good idea regardless, but I wouldn’t put my bare feet (or even with socks) on that surface.  One feature we liked…",Jan-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,delicious afternoon tea!!,"First time having tea here at Fullerton hotel with my friend and I find it very interesting! It was great and the hotel ambience is perfect. Staffs are such lovely like Lalikumar, Aldin and Camilla. I feel very welcome because they’re really nice, friendly and always smile while serving us the food.",Jan-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Ken and Lynne Shaw,"The whole 7 night stay was perfect particularly as the hotel was operating in the current very difficult circumstances.  The staff were charming and professional particularly as the current atmosphere is somewhat subdued.  Paolo and Chia Yi in the Club looked after us particularly well and Sall at the pool was as always the perfect host making our leisure hours most enjoyable.  It was also very comforting to see staff checking guests temperatures when appropriate, very important in the current situation.  This was our second week stay and the location staff and hotel ambiance could not have been improved.",Mar-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,May-20,5,Exceeded Expectations,"Catching up to review a stay at The Fullerton towards the end of February, we chose to stopover in Singapore at the end of our honeymoon and it was a lovely place to stay for the end of our holiday.  We stayed in one of the refurbished Marina Bay view rooms, both view and room was great! We were also greeted with a lovely treat which was very appreciated (and tasty!).  The service here was excellent to say the least, very warm and welcoming, and all the staff were so helpful.  The only minor hiccup we had was on our morning of check out, we decided to sleep in as I wasn't feeling too well to leave earlier. However we were taken by surprise by renovation noises that seemed to be coming from directly above us (after around 9am), which was incredibly loud.   We didn't recall…",Feb-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Stopover,"We stayed at the Fullerton for 4 nights between Christmas and New Year en route to Bali. Very stylish with a colonial feel hotel in a great central location for exploring Singapore. Rooms large and comfortable , we had standard looking into atrium but others looking out onto city must be spectacular. Staff very friendly and helpful , couldn’t fault the service. Buffet breakfast huge choice and very good. You could also use the facilities of the nearby sister hotels on the bay front. Would highly recommend staying here and would definitely come here again when visiting/ passing through Singapore",Dec-19,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Afternoon tea at The Courtyard,"Great service with good variety and quality food.

Highly recommended for anyone that wants a relaxing afternoon to celebrate a special occasion. Special thanks to Lalikumar, Camilla, Lai and Miyako for making our visit so wonderful.",Jan-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Aug-20,5,Living Up to Reputation,"I had initially written a review regarding some lapses regarding in room service which made a  disappointing stay, especially when I was there to celebrate an occasion. However, hotel made an effort for service recovery which they didn't have to. The attempt at service recovery shows that Fullerton lives up to its reputation as being a top Singapore hotel and I believe they genuinely strive to make each guest experience a positive one. As per my original review (which I've accidentally deleted) kudos to the dining team especially Lalikumar and colleagues at the Courtyard. He made our experience much better and now with the service recovery by Roszel, we have no doubts about returning and recommending Fullerton Hotel to others be it for dining or staying. We will be back.",Aug-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Dinner @jade Fullerton,"YVONNE was extremely helpful in recommending the dishes.  She was very observant and made sure we were well looked after.

It was comforting to finally have a staycation after weeks of being bounded at home due to the circuit breaker. The service was excellent. Everyone was warm and friendly. We extremely enjoyed the high tea at The  Courtyard. Miyako was very accommodating. She patiently checked on us now and then to see if we needed a refill of drinks or replenishment of food. Hope sincerily chatted with us to find out how we were doing. Josephine and Sherlyn were nice too. No wonder the hotel had lasted this long. Hospitality is everything. Thank you for a memorable and pleasant stay, Fullerton!",Jul-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Jade @Fullerton Hotel - Nothing but AWESOME,"Superior food presentation with splendid flavours, bright & cheery ambience along with six star service  - these sum up my wonderful birthday celebration at top-notch restaurant Jade @Fullerton Hotel.   Every dish is special, uniquely cooked and presented with care - that explained the slightly longer than usual waiting time in between dishes but we were ok since fine dining should not be a rushed affair but an opportunity for us to slowly savour the palatable cuisine and enjoy meaningful conversations.   Special mention to Yvonne and Yoppy who were attentive and thoughtful to our needs, further enhancing our pleasant dining experience.   We will certainly be back!",Mar-20,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Sep-20,5,Fantastic Fullerton service,"We booked a loft suite during the September holidays and this is our very first time here. Amidst the covid19 pandemic, Fullerton did not fail to impress with their trademark customer service. From front desk (Kate) who was so swift and pleasant, to the wonderful guest executives Norish and Siti at the straits club who really went all out to make sure that our kids and us were well fed  (wonderful high tea and cocktail sessions) to the friendly pool attendant and spa attendant as well as very quick room service who delivered our requests within 10 minutes (an extra bed mind you!), we are thoroughly spoiled and impressed :) the kids love the stuffed Fullerton bears and the glamping experience and we can’t wait to come back again.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Recent Two Night Stay,We recently stayed two nights at the Fullerton Hotel . We were suppose to be travelling to Christchurch New Zealand but after one night stay we found that the New Zealand Government had decreed that our two week holiday booked touring South Island would have to be in self quarantine  We were unable to contact our travel insurance or tour operator or airline. Spent hours on the phone to no avail.Very stressed. Trip was to see our daughter in New Zealand so was upsetting it was no longer possible  Sue Kim on front reception late at night went above and beyond her role to help us try and get a flight home to London the next day.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Great,"Stayed here a few days in a Postmaster Room. Check in was a breeze and the staff was friendly and aware we had been traveling for 20 hours to get there. The room was on the smaller size but nicely appointed, clean, and the bed was terrifically comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and like the room, well appointed.  Went to the Town Restaurant in the lobby which was great for an early dinner and some drinks. The roof top bar was also nice after a long day of sight seeing.   The pool overlooking the river is great. It gets crowded but we always had a seat to lounge on. The pool attendant is terrific. Very responsive and so nice.  The hotel is in a great location and in a wonderfully preserved building that stands out surrounded by sky scrapers.   I would stay here again and hope…",Feb-20,,

We merely commented about our surprise to the front desk. 2 hours later the front office manager Warren Vergara Naluz approached us with an apology and a bottle of wine. That was so considerate.

It was a difficult time due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the low numbers of visitors and hotel guests. Despite very low numbers of hotel guests, and the hidden, personal COVID-19 related problems that most staff had to address in their personal lives, the staff could not have been more helpful, considerate and courteous. They were determined to make life as normal and easy for their guests, despite the prevailing circumstances. Staff attention to hygiene, and measures to limit COVID-19 risk were excellent. Hand sanitisation units were everywhere. Sall - the pool attendant could not have been more helpful - he obviously takes great pride in his work and in…",Mar-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Mar-20,5,Best in Singapore.,"We stayed at the Fullerton Hotel as a stopover in Singapore, en route from New Zealand to London. What a fabulous colonial style hotel this is, the staff are excellent, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of their city. The Hotel was the old GPO office and government buildings during its colonial life, once the busiest in Asia. It’s had an amazing renovation into the city’s best hotel, we’ve been to Raffles, and the Fullerton is better. The public areas are huge, immaculate and spotlessly clean, so are the bedrooms, we had room 603 on the front of the hotel, facing the marina area, fantastic views, and a lovely room. It’s probably in the best location for visiting all the attractions, and a few minutes walk to the MTR. We would recommend the Fullerton to anyone visiting…",Mar-20,,

I received an email prior to my arrival offering pickup service from the airport (for an exorbitant fee) and letting me know my temperature would be taken on arrival due to Coronavirus concerns (fine by me).  During my late afternoon check in process, the employee mention with a flippant “by the way” attitude that they were doing plumbing construction on the 7th floor- my room was on the 6th floor- but that any noise would be intermittent and from the hours of 10-6pm.

The breakfast was superb. We were due to stay 4 days/5 nights.  However, there were glitches immediately. The HVAC system in the (very expensive) suite we booked did not work. Neither did the TV, in either room. The front desk sent up engineering right away, who fixed both TVs and jiggled with the AC, claiming it would be ""better now."" However, the room remained freezing and adjusting the thermostat proved pointless.  We again spoke to the front desk, and again engineering came up and again declared it better. After the 3rd day (and night) freezing, management realized engineering was unable to fix it and so had to call in an outside contractor.

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Should I miss my flight so I can eat more at Fullerton?,"Came here for a couple work meetings, my business partner and I decided to try the Indian buffet based on a local's resounding recommendation.  Ahm ah-mazing.  I grew up on Indian food and am a so-called foodie -- never seen such high quality in a buffet at a reasonable price (came to ~40 USD / person). Hand-made dosas? Check. Chutneys of vibrant colors? Check. Fresh lassi and tea? Check. And on top of that the service from Lalikumar, Lai and Albert was outstanding, which is what prompted me to write this rare review.  Wondering if I should miss my flight tomorrow so I can eat the buffet again.",Jan-20,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Jan-20,5,Fullerton - Return to the era of grace and style,"Hands down, the BEST hotel I've ever stayed in.  Stayed here for 4 days after a SCUBA trip to Sulewesi Indonesia.  Posh is the word that best describes the Fullerton.  Breakfast each day was excellent - select your cuisine: western or eastern, it is all fabulous.  Service is impeccable - after the first day our server remembered the kind of coffee and juices we liked with our meal.  Location is in the heart of town on the Singapore River.  Easy walk to many sites and museums - check out the Asian Cultural Musern and see artifacts from a 650 A,D. shipwreck.    Best value for your dollar.  Room price was about 40% less than what I have paid for 3-star, 1950s era motels in northern Michigan in the summer season.",Sep-19,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,5,Christmas Staycation@Fullerton Hotel,"Had our staycation from 24 to 27 Dec and we had such an amazing time!!  We booked two Palladian Suites with amazing views -  (one was facing the Marina and the other was facing the river) - the video of the rooms are posted at my IG - we love our rooms (we hate that we had to check out)   Turn down service is always pampering and glad Fullerton still provides it   A special call out to Haslina, who was amazing in helping to coordinate our itinerary , being so patient with my queries and the outcome was we had a simply fabulous stay!!  Spa was so pleasant and wonderful , thanks Julian for arranging our booking and thanks Diane for the relaxing massage!!!

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Dec-20,4,Great staycay but could be better!,"I just returned from the staycation at The Fullerton Hot with my family. We have 2 adults and 2 kids and was here to celebrate my son’s birthday. We had a great stay but I felt it could have been better.   The good:  The hotel was really beautiful. Our room was a heritage room with a mini balcony but that room has no view. We would prefer a room with view but we are okay as the room is already fantastic.  The room was big and still have ample space after putting in an extra bed. Bed was comfortable. The shower was strong and whether we bathe in the bathtub or rain shower, it was simply relaxing. My kids enjoyed both. The bathroom was huge and brightly lit.   Majority of the hotel staff were very polite and helped us and ushered us all the way to our room. The entire hotel was…",Dec-20,,
The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Nov-20,1,Lana A,"This is my worst stay in so called 5* hotel anywhere in the world. “Premier courtroom” is a very small room. They advertise it’s suitable for 2 adults and 2 children - but there is simply no room for extra bed in the room I am allocated. You can’t choose your time for breakfast or pool - they claim everything is booked! High tea is also booked! Check in took me over 1 hour - reception people tried to contact restaurant to arrange time for the restaurant but so far managed only breakfast. They claimed it’s due to government regulations - but I’d say it’s due to management wanting to squeeze as much money as they can while seriously compromising on service they provide! Nowhere in the world was I left without being able to have a meal at the hotel restaurant. Oh, and I have to…",Nov-20,,
